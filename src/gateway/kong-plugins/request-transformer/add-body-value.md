title: "Adding attributes to HTTP requests with Kong Gateway"
description: "A no-code solution to modifying requests for your APIs"
---

It's very common to have an HTTP service which accepts requests expecting a JSON document in the body.
Let's assume that the development team of your service plans to change the request API in the near future, 
and will eventually begin to require a new field in the JSON body of the requests. 
Eventually your client applications will need to upgrade their requests to support this new value, 
but how could you provide a default value for your services in the meantime?

[{{site.base_gateway}}](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/) supports a [Plugin](/hub/) 
architecture including a [Request Transformer Plugin](/hub/kong-inc/request-transformer/) 
that can modify incoming requests before proxying them to your upstream service. 
This can all be accomplished using a no-code solution and managed with no downtime using 
Kong's dynamic administrative capabilities.

This guide will show you how to configure the Request Transformer plugin using 
the [Kong Admin API](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api/) to modify incoming 
requests with a static constant value. Then you will test the feature with a mock 
request to verify the transformation process.

### Prerequisites

* This document is best used after following the companion 
[{{site.base_gateway}} in minutes](/gateway/latest/get-started/) guide, which
walks you through running a local {{site.base_gateway}} in Docker, setting up
a mock [service](/gateway/latest/admin-api/#service-object), and the necessary connection details. 
If you'd like to use an existing {{site.base_gateway}} or a different service, you will need to adjust the 
commands in this guide as necessary.
* You have [`curl`](https://curl.se/) installed on your system, which is used to send 
requests to the gateway. Most systems come with `curl` pre-installed.
* This guide uses the [`jq`](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) command line JSON processing tool. While
this tool is not necessary to complete the tasks, it's helpful for processing JSON responses from
the gateway. If you do not have `jq` or do not wish to install it, you can modify the commands to remove
`jq` processing.

### Steps

There are a large number of Kong plugins, many of which need to 
be [custom installed](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/plugin-development/distribution/) 
prior to utilization. Kong ships prepackaged with a number of useful plugins including
the Request Transformer you will use in this guide.

First verify the Request Transformer plugin is available on your gateway by querying the Admin API and using `jq` to filter the response looking at the plugins available on the server.

```sh
curl -s $KONG_ADMIN_API | \
  jq -r '.plugins.available_on_server."request-transformer"'
```

The command output should be:
```
true
```

Now, assign a new instance of the Request Transformer plugin to
the mock service by sending a `POST` request to the Admin API.
In this command, the `config.add.body` value instructs the plugin to add a new
field to the body of incoming requests before forwarding them to the `mock` service.
In this example, we are instructing the plugin to add a field named `new-field` and 
give it a static value of `defaultValue`. 

```sh
curl -i -X POST $KONG_ADMIN_API/services/mock/plugins \
  --data "name=request-transformer" \
  --data "config.add.body=new-field:defaultValue"
```

If successful the API will return a `201 Created` HTTP response code with a 
JSON body including information about the new plugin instance.

{:.note}
> **Note:** The Request Transformer can perform more complex transformations than 
shown here, see the [full documentation](/hub/kong-inc/request-transformer/) for the details.

Next, use the `mock` service's `/requests` endpoint to test the behavior of the plugin.
The `/requests` API will echo back helpful information from the request we send it, including
headers and the request body.

```sh
curl -s -XPOST $KONG_PROXY/mock/requests \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-d '{"existing-field": "abc123"}'
```

The JSON response will contain the `postData` field which includes the 
JSON body sent to the service. You can use `jq` to fully extract the request body 
returned from the `mock` service, as follows:

```sh
curl -s -XPOST $KONG_PROXY/mock/requests \
	-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
	-d '{"existing-field": "Kong FTW!"}' | \
	jq -r '.postData.text'
```

This will output the following text indicating `new-field` has been added to the request body.

```txt
{"existing-field":"Kong FTW!","new-field":"defaultValue"}
```

### What's next?

* More advanced transformations can be accomplished with the 
[Request Transformer Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/request-transformer-advanced/) 
plugin.
* If no standard plugin is available to satisfy your use case, the 
[Plugin Development Guide](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/plugin-development/) 
can help you with developing your own plugin.
