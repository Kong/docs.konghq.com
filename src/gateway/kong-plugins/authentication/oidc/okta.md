This guide covers an example OpenID Connect plugin configuration to authenticate browser clients using an Okta identity provider.

For information about configuring OIDC using Okta as an Identity provider
in conjunction with the Application Registration plugin, see
[Set Up External Portal Application Authentication with Okta and OIDC](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/okta-config).

## Authorization code flow with the OpenID Connect plugin and Okta

### Sign-in flow

![OIDC sign-in flow](/assets/images/docs/ee/plugins/oidc-use-case/OIDCsignin.png)

1. If the client does not have a session cookie, it initiates sign in with Kong.
2. Kong responds to the client with an **authorization cookie** and a location to redirect (with Okta as the header).
3. the client redirects to Okta so the user can sign in.
4. Okta responds with an **authorization code** and a location to redirect (with Kong as the header).

At this point, the client has successfully signed in and has an **authorization code** (from Okta) and an **authorization cookie** (from Kong).

### Access flow

![OIDC access flow](/assets/images/docs/ee/plugins/oidc-use-case/OIDCaccess.png)

1. The client redirects to Kong and automatically sends the **authorization code** (from Okta) and an **authorization cookie** (from Kong).
2. Kong verifies the **authorization code** with Okta.
3. Okta sends and **access token** and **ID token** to Kong.
4. Kong proxies the client request with the **access token** from Okta.
5. Kong receives a service response.
6. Kong sends the service response to the client, along with a **session cookie** for future access.

At this point, the client now has a **session** with Kong that allows mediated access to the service.

### Session flow

![OIDC session flow](/assets/images/docs/ee/plugins/oidc-use-case/OIDCsession.png)

1. The client sends requests with a **session cookie**.
2. Kong matches the session cookie to the associate **access token** and proxies the request.
3. Kong gets a response from the service.
4. Kong sends the response to the client.

Kongâ€™s session with the client ensures that the client does not need to make constant requests to Okta. The duration of the session can be configured.

## Example of configuring the OIDC plugin with Okta

### Prerequisites

The steps in the guide offer an example of configuring OIDC with Okta on a specific route. To follow this guide, you need the following:

* A [developer account](https://developer.okta.com) with Okta.
* A running version of {{site.base_gateway}}.
* Access to the [OpenID Connect plugin](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect).
* A [service](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api/#service-object)
and [route](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api/#route-object) in
{{site.base_gateway}} whose access you want to protect with Okta. For this
guide, assume the route is in the default workspace.
* If using {{site.base_gateway}} locally, you need Internet access.
* Any network access control to your Kong node must allow traffic to and from Okta, the upstream service, and the client.

    For security reasons, make sure all requests are sent over HTTPS, and make the Kong proxy available
     with a fully-qualified domain name and [properly configured certificate](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api/#certificate-object).
     Authorization tokens should also be stored securely.

### Configure Okta

1. [Register](https://developer.okta.com/docs/guides/add-an-external-idp/openidconnect/register-app-in-okta/) the application you are using Kong to proxy.
1. From the left menu, select **Applications**, then **Create App Integration**.
1. Select the application type:

    1. Under **Sign-in method**, select **OIDC - OpenID Connect**.
    1. Under **Application Type**, select **Web Application**.

1. Select **Next**. Configure the application:
    1. Create a unique name for your application.
    1. Under **Grant Type**, select **Authorization Code**.
    1. In both the **Sign-in redirect URIs** and
    **Sign-out redirect URIs** fields, enter a location handled by your Route
    in {{site.base_gateway}}.

        For this example, you can enter `https://kong.com/api`.

    1. In the Assignments section, for **Controlled access**, choose your
    preferred access level for this application. This preferred access level sets the permissions for
    Okta admins. 
    
    Do not select **Allow everyone in your organization to access** otherwise the **access token** won't be verified against Okta.
    
    Either select **Limit access to selected groups** or **Skip group assignment for now** and assign the users and groups in a later step.

1. Save your settings to generate connection details.

    Leave this page open. You'll need the details here to configure the Kong OIDC plugin.

1. Add an Authorization Server. From the left sidebar, go to
**Security > API > Authorization Server** and create a server named
 **Kong API Management** with an audience and description. Click **Save**.

    On the page that appears, note the **Issuer** address. You need this address
    to configure the Kong OIDC Plugin.

1. Now add a policy from the **Access Policies** tab.
    1. Click **Add New Access Policy** and add a **Name** and **Description**    
    1. Add a **rule**
    1. Assign a **Rule Name** and use the default settings, or adjust to your requirements.
    1. Click **Create Rule**

### Configure the OIDC plugin in {{site.base_gateway}}

#### Minimum configuration requirements

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Configure plugin with Kong Manager %}

1. In Kong Manager, from the Workspaces tab, select the workspace where your
route is configured.

1. Click **Routes** in the left navigation.

1. On the Routes page, select the route you have configured to protect with
Okta and click **View**.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Add Plugin**.

1. Select the **OpenID Connect** plugin.

1. On the plugin's configuration, in the **Common** tab, configure the
following, at minimum:

    1. **Issuer (Discovery Document URI)**:

        ```
        https://{YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN}/oauth2/{YOUR_AUTH_SERVER}/.well-known/openid-configuration
        ```

        The `issuer` URL can be found in your Authorization Server settings.

    1. **Client ID**: `{YOUR_CLIENT_ID}`

        Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with the client ID shown in your Okta
        application's **General** page.

    1. **Client Secret**: `{YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET}`

        Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET` with the client secret shown in your Okta
        application's **General** page.

    1. **Auth Methods**: `Authorization code flow`

        This parameter lists of all the authentication methods
        that you want the plugin to accept. If you don't select an auth method,
        all auth methods are allowed by default.

1. On the **Authorization** tab, configure the following, at a minimum:

    1. For **config.scopes required**, enter `openid, email, profile`. This parameter is the scope of what OpenID Connect checks.

    1. For **config.scopes claim**, enter `scp`.

1. Switch to the **Advanced** tab and fill out **config.redirect_uri** with
 `https://kong.com/api`.

    The `redirect_uri` should be the URI you specified earlier when configuring
     your app. This is the `redirect_uri` of the client defined with `client_id` (also used as a redirection URI for the authorization code flow).

1. Click **Create** to save and apply the plugin to the Route.

For a list of all available configuration parameters and what they do, see the
[OIDC plugin reference](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect).

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Configure plugin with Admin API %}

Configure the OpenID Connect plugin using the following sample values:

```bash
curl -i -X POST https://KONG_ADMIN_URL/routes/ROUTE_ID/plugins \
  --data name="openid-connect"                                                                             \
  --data config.issuer="https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN/oauth2/YOUR_AUTH_SERVER/.well-known/openid-configuration" \
  --data config.client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID"                                                                 \
  --data config.client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"                                                         \
  --data config.redirect_uri="https://kong.com/api"                                                        \
  --data config.scopes_claim="scp"                                                                         \
  --data config.scopes="openid"                                                                            \
  --data config.scopes="email"                                                                             \
  --data config.scopes="profile"                                                                           \
  --data config.auth_methods=authorization_code
```

In this example, the configuration contains the following values:

* **`issuer`**: The issuer `url` from which OpenID Connect configuration can be discovered. Using Okta, specify the domain and server in the path:
    * `https://YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN/oauth2/YOUR_AUTH_SERVER/.well-known/openid-configuration`
* **`auth_method`**: A list of authentication methods to use with the plugin, such as passwords, introspection tokens, etc. The majority of cases use `authorization_code`, and {{site.base_gateway}} will accept all methods if no methods are specified.
* **`client_id`**: The `client_id` of the OpenID Connect client registered in OpenID Connect Provider. Okta provides one to identify itself.  
* **`client_secret`**: The `client_secret` of the OpenID Connect client registered in OpenID Connect Provider. These credentials should never be publicly exposed.
* **`config.scopes_required`**:  The scope of what OpenID Connect checks. This is set to `openid` by default. You must also set `email` and `profile` for this example. 
* **`config.scopes_claim`**: This should be set to `scp`.
* **`config.redirect_uri`**: The `redirect_uri` of the client defined with `client_id` (also used as a redirection URI for the authorization code flow).

For a list of all available configuration parameters and what they do, see the
[OIDC plugin reference](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect).

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

Visiting a URL matched by that route in a browser will now redirect to Okta's authentication
site and return you to the redirect URI after authenticating.

### Test Your Configuration

Test the following conditions to ensure a successful integration of the OIDC plugin with Okta:

* Unauthorized access to a route is blocked
* Authorized access is allowed after login/providing first set of credentials
    * Ensure the identity is registered with the IdP
    * Steps for debugging
* Authorized access is allowed on immediate subsequent attempts
    * Perhaps highlight where the cookie is stored
* Previously authorized access is no longer allowed after cookie terminates
    * Set a very short TTL on the session to ensure the tester doesnâ€™t need to wait long to get locked out

### Access Restrictions

The example configuration allows users to authenticate and access the Route even though
no Consumer was created for them. Any user with a valid account in the directory
will have access to the Route. The OIDC plugin allows this as the simplest authentication option,
but you may wish to restrict access further. There are several options for this:

- Consumer Mapping
- Pseudo-Consumer Mapping

#### Consumer Mapping

If you need to interact with other Kong plugins using consumer information, you
can add configuration that maps account data received from the identity provider to a Kong consumer.
For this example, the user's Okta's AD account GUID is mapped to a Consumer by setting it
as the `custom_id` on their consumer:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://admin.kong.example/consumers/ \
  --data username="Yoda" \
  --data custom_id="e5634b31-d67f-4661-a6fb-b6cb77849bcf"
```

```bash
curl -i -X PATCH http://admin.kong.example/plugins/OIDC_PLUGIN_ID \
  --data config.consumer_by="custom_id" \
  --data config.consumer_claim="sub"
```

Now, if a user logs into an Okta account with the GUID `e5634b31-d67f-4661-a6fb-b6cb77849bcf`, Kong will apply configuration associated with the Consumer `Yoda` to their requests.

This also requires that clients login using an account mapped to some Consumer, which might
not be desirable (e.g., you apply OpenID Connect to a service, but only use plugins
requiring a Consumer on some Routes). To deal with this, you can set the `anonymous` parameter
in your OIDC plugin configuration to the ID of a generic Consumer, which will
then be used for all authenticated users that cannot be mapped to some other Consumer.
You can alternately set `consumer_optional` to `true` to allow similar logins
without mapping an anonymous Consumer.

#### Pseudo-consumers

For plugins that typically require consumers, the OIDC plugin can provide a consumer ID based on the value of a claim without mapping to an actual Consumer. Setting `credential_claim` to a claim [in your plugin configuration][credential-claim] will extract the value of that claim and use it where Kong would normally use a consumer ID. Note that this may not work with all consumer-related functionality.

Similarly, setting `authenticated_groups_claim` will extract that claim's value and use it as a group for the ACL plugin.
