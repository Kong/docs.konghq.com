title: Dev Portal CLI

The Kong Dev Portal CLI is used to manage your Dev Portals from the
command line. It is built using [clipanion][clipanion].

This is the next generation TypeScript based Dev Portal CLI. The goal of
this project is to make a higher quality CLI tool over the initial sync script.


## Install

```
> npm install -g kong-portal-cli
```

## Usage

The easiest way to start is by cloning the [portal-templates repo][templates]
master branch locally.

Next, edit `workspaces/default/cli.conf.yaml` to set workspace `name` and `rbac_token`
to match your setup.

Make sure Kong is running and portal is on.

Now, from the root folder of the templates repo, you can run:

```portal [-h,--help] [--config PATH] [-v,--verbose] <command> <workspace>```

Where `<command>` is one of:

* `config`   Output or change configuration of the portal on the given
`workspace`, locally.
* `deploy`   Deploy changes made locally under the given workspace upstream.
* `disable`  Disable the portal on the given workspace.
* `enable`   Enable the portal on the given workspace.
* `fetch`    Fetches content and themes from the given workspace.
* `wipe`     Deletes all content and themes from upstream workspace

Where `<workspace>` indicates the directory/workspace pairing you would like to operate on.

#### For `deploy`
- Add `-W` or `--watch` to make changes reactive.
- Add `-P` or `--preserve` to avoid deleting files upstream that you do not have locally.
- Add `-D` or `--disable-ssl-verification` to disable SSL verification and use self-signed certs.
- Add `-I` or `--ignore-specs` to ignore the `/specs` directory.

#### For `fetch`
- Add `-K` or `--keep-encode` to keep binary assets as base64-encoded strings locally.
- Add `-D` or `--disable-ssl-verification` to disable SSL verification and use self-signed certs.
- Add `-I` or `--ignore-specs` to ignore the `/specs` directory.

#### For `wipe`
- Add `-D` or `--disable-ssl-verification` to disable SSL verification and use self-signed certs.
- Add `-I` or `--ignore-specs` to ignore the `/specs` directory.

#### For `enable` and `disable`
- Add `-D` or `--disable-ssl-verification` to disable SSL verification and use self-signed certs.
