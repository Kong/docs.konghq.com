## Approving Developers

Developers who have requested access to a Dev Portal will appear under the
**Requested Access** tab. From this tab, you can choose to *Accept* or *Reject*
the developer from the actions in the table row. After selecting an action, the
corresponding tab is updated.


## View Approved Developers

To view all currently approved developers, click the **Approved** tab. From here, you can choose to *Revoke* or *Delete* a particular developer. Additionally, you can use this view to send an email to a developer with the **Email Developer** `mailto` link. See [Emailing Developers](#emailing-developers) for more info.


## View Revoked Developers

To view all currently revoked developers, click the **Revoked** tab. From here, you can choose to *Re-approve* or *Delete* a developer.


### View Rejected Developers

To view all currently rejected developers, click the **Rejected** tab. Rejected developers completed the registration flow on your Dev Portal but were rejected from the **Request Access** tab. You may *Approve* or *Delete* a developer from this tab.


## Email Developers

### Invite Developers to Register

To invite a single or multiple developers:
