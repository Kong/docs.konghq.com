{{site.base_gateway}} provides support for the Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS 140-2). Compliance with this standard is typically required for working with U.S. federal government agencies and their contractors.

{{site.base_gateway}} offers a FIPS package. The package replaces the primary library in {{site.base_gateway}}, OpenSSL, with the [BoringSSL](https://boringssl.googlesource.com/boringssl/), which at its core uses the FIPS 140-2 compliant BoringCrypto for cryptographic operations.

{{site.base_gateway}} uses BoringSSL algorithms in all core components when configured.

### Configure FIPS
