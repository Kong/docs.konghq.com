Before upgrading, review any configuration or breaking changes in this version and prior versions that affect your current installation.

You may need to adopt different upgrade paths depending on your deployment methods, set of features in use, custom plugins, for example.

## Deployment

### Amazon Linux 2022 to 2023 rename

Amazon Linux 2022 artifacts are renamed to Amazon Linux 2023, based on AWS's own renaming.

### Ubuntu 18.04 support removed 

> Patch version: 2.8.4.3

Support for running {{site.base_gateway}} on Ubuntu 18.04 ("Bionic") is now deprecated,
as [Standard Support for Ubuntu 18.04 has ended as of June 2023](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases).
Starting with {{site.base_gateway}} 2.8.4.3, Kong is not building new Ubuntu 18.04
images or packages, and Kong will not test package installation on Ubuntu 18.04.

## Plugins

For breaking changes to plugins, see the [{{site.base_gateway}} Changelog](/gateway/changelog/) for your {{site.base_gateway}} version.
