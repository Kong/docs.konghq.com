Kong Manager is the graphical user interface (GUI) for {{site.base_gateway}}. It uses the Kong Admin API under the hood to administer and control {{site.base_gateway}}.

Here are some of the things you can do with Kong Manager:

* Create new routes and services.
* Activate or deactivate plugins.
* Group your teams, services, plugins, consumer management, and everything else exactly how you want them.
* Monitor performance: visualize cluster-wide, workspace-level, or even object-level health using intuitive, customizable dashboards.

> **Note**: If you are running Kong in traditional mode, increased traffic could
> lead to potential performance with Kong Proxy.
> Server-side sorting and filtering large quantities of entities will also cause increased CPU usage in both Kong CP and database.
