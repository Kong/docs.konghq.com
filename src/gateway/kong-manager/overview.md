Kong Manager is the graphical user interface (GUI) for Kong Gateway. It uses the Kong Admin API under the hood to administer and control Kong Gateway.

Here are some of the things you can do with Kong Manager:

* Create new Routes and Services.
* Activate or deactivate plugins with a couple of clicks.
* Group your teams, services, plugins, consumer management, and everything else exactly how you want them.
* Monitor performance: visualize cluster-wide, workspace-level, or even object-level health using intuitive, customizable dashboards.

> **Note**: If you are running Kong in traditional mode, increased traffic could
> lead to potential performance with Kong Proxy.
> Server-side sorting and filtering large quantities of entities will also cause increased CPU usage in both Kong CP and database.
