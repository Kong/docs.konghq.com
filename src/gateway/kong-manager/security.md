title: Securing Kong Manager
badge: enterprise

Kong Manager enables users with Admin accounts to access Kong entities such
as Services, Plugins, and Consumers.

The following document summarizes Kong Manager's controls for *authentication*
and *authorization*.

## Configuring Authentication

{{site.base_gateway}} comes packaged with Authentication Plugins that can be used
to secure Kong Manager. Unlike enabling a Plugin on an entity or cluster,
enabling an Authentication Plugin for *only* Kong Manager requires turning
on `enforce_rbac`, setting `admin_gui_auth` to the desired type, proper
configuration of `admin_gui_session_conf`, and configuring `admin_gui_auth_conf`
if needed.

Kong Manager currently supports the following Authentication Plugins:

* [Basic Auth](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/authentication/basic/)
* [OIDC](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/authentication/oidc-mapping/)
* [LDAP](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/authentication/ldap/)

In addition to the Authentication Plugins above, the new
[Sessions Plugin](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/authentication/sessions/)
is now required when RBAC is enabled. It sends HTTP cookies to authenticate
client requests and maintain session information.

The Sessions Plugin requries a secret and is configured
securely by default.
* Under all circumstances, the `secret` must be manually set to a string.
* If using HTTP instead of HTTPS, `cookie_secure` must be manually set to `false`.
* If using different domains for the Admin API and Kong Manager,
`cookie_samesite` must be set to `off`.
Learn more about these properties in
[Session Security in Kong Manager](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/authentication/sessions/#session-security),
and see [example configurations](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/authentication/sessions/#example-configurations).

## Access Control with Roles and Workspaces

An Admin belongs to a Workspace and should have at least one Role
with a set of Permissions. If an Admin is in a Workspace *without*
a Role, they will not have the ability to see or interact with anything.

By creating separate
[Workspaces](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/workspaces/workspaces/),
 an organization with multiple teams can segment its Kong cluster so that
 different teams do not have access to each other's Kong entities.

{{site.base_gateway}} implements Role-Based Access Control
([RBAC](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/rbac/)).
Admins are assigned Roles that have clearly defined Permissions. A
Super Admin has the ability to:

* Further customize Permissions
* Create entirely new Roles
* Invite or deactivate Admins
* Assign or revoke their Roles

In Kong Manager, limiting Permissions also restricts the visibility of the
application interface and navigation. Learn more about RBAC in Kong Manager in
our guide
[RBAC in Kong Manager](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-manager/rbac/).
