Using the [ring-balancer](/gateway/latest/how-kong-works/load-balancing/#ring-balancer), target weights can be adjusted granularly, allowing
for a smooth, controlled canary release.

Using a very simple two target example:

```bash
# first target at 1000
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/upstreams/address.v2.service/targets \
    --data "target=192.168.34.17:80"
    --data "weight=1000"
```

```sh
# second target at 0
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/upstreams/address.v2.service/targets \
    --data "target=192.168.34.18:80"
    --data "weight=0"
```

By repeating the requests, but altering the weights each time, traffic will
slowly be routed towards the other target. For example, set it at 10%:

```bash
# first target at 900
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/upstreams/address.v2.service/targets \
    --data "target=192.168.34.17:80"
    --data "weight=900"
```

```sh
# second target at 100
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/upstreams/address.v2.service/targets \
    --data "target=192.168.34.18:80"
    --data "weight=100"
```

The changes through the {{site.base_gateway}} Admin API are dynamic and take
effect immediately. No reload or restart is required, and no in progress
requests are dropped.
