title: Using Gateway API
alpha: true
---

[Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) is a set of resources for
configuring networking in Kubernetes. It expands on Ingress to configure
additional types of routes (TCP, UDP, and TLS in addition to HTTP/HTTPS),
support backends other than Service, and manage the proxies that implement
routes.

Gateway API and Kong's implementation of Gateway API are both in alpha stage and
under active development. Features and implementation specifics will change
before their initial general availability release.

## Enable the feature

The Gateway API CRDs are not yet available by default in Kubernetes. You must
first [install them](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/v1alpha2/guides/getting-started/#installing-gateway-api-crds-manually).

The default controller configuration disables Gateway API handling. To enable
it, set `ingressController.env.feature_gates: Gateway=true` in your Helm
`values.yaml`, or set `CONTROLLER_FEATURE_GATES=Gateway=true` if not using Helm.
Note that you must restart Pods with this flag set _after_ installing the
Gateway API CRDs.

If using Helm, you must use chart version 2.7 or higher. Older versions do not
include the ServiceAccount permissions necessary for KIC to read Gateway API
resources.

## Testing connectivity to Kong

This guide assumes that the `PROXY_IP` environment variable is
set to contain the IP address or URL pointing to Kong.
Follow one of the
[deployment guides](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/{{page.kong_version}}/deployment/overview) to configure this environment variable.

If everything is set up correctly, making a request to Kong should return
HTTP 404 Not Found.

{:.note}
> **Note**: If you are running the example using Minikube on MacOS, you may need 
to run [`minikube tunnel`](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/accessing/#loadbalancer-access)
in a separate terminal window.  This exposes LoadBalancer services 
externally, which is not enabled by default.

```bash
$ curl -i $PROXY_IP
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Length: 48
Server: kong/1.2.1

{"message":"no Route matched with those values"}
```

This is expected, as Kong does not yet know how to proxy the request.

## Set up an echo-server

Set up an echo-server application to demonstrate how
to use the {{site.kic_product_name}}:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://bit.ly/echo-service
```

## Add a GatewayClass and Gateway

The Gateway resource represents the proxy instance that handles traffic for a
set of Gateway API routes, and a GatewayClass describes characteristics shared
by all Gateways of a given type.

Add a GatewayClass:

```bash
$ echo "apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: GatewayClass
metadata:
  name: kong
spec:
  controllerName: konghq.com/kic-gateway-controller
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

```
gatewayclass.gateway.networking.k8s.io/kong created
```

Add a Gateway: 

```bash
$ echo "apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  annotations:
    konghq.com/gateway-unmanaged: kong/kong-proxy
  name: kong
spec:
  gatewayClassName: kong
  listeners:
  - name: proxy
    port: 80
    protocol: HTTP
  - name: proxy-ssl
    port: 443
    protocol: HTTPS
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

```
gateway.gateway.networking.k8s.io/kong created
```

Because KIC and Kong instances are installed independent of their Gateway
resource, we set the `konghq.com/gateway-unmanaged` annotation to the
`<namespace>/<name>` of the Kong proxy Service. This instructs KIC to populate
that Gateway resource with listener and status information. You can check to
confirm if KIC has updated the bound Gateway by inspecting the list of
associated addresses:

```bash
$ kubectl get gateway kong -o=jsonpath='{.status.addresses}' | jq
```

```
[
  {
    "type": "IPAddress",
    "value": "10.96.179.122"
  },
  {
    "type": "IPAddress",
    "value": "10.96.179.122"
  },
  {
    "type": "IPAddress",
    "value": "172.18.0.240"
  }
]
```

## Add an HTTPRoute

HTTPRoute resources are similar to Ingress resources: they contain a set of
matching criteria for HTTP requests and upstream Services to route those
requests to.

```bash
$ echo "apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1alpha2
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: echo
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - group: gateway.networking.k8s.io
    kind: Gateway
    name: kong
  rules:
  - backendRefs:
    - group: ""
      kind: Service
      name: echo
      port: 80
      weight: 1
    matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /echo
" | kubectl apply -f -
```

After creating an HTTPRoute, accessing `/echo` forwards a request to the
echo service:

```bash
$ curl -i $PROXY_IP/echo
```

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Connection: keep-alive
Date: Fri, 21 Jun 2019 18:09:02 GMT
Server: echoserver
X-Kong-Upstream-Latency: 1
X-Kong-Proxy-Latency: 1
Via: kong/1.1.2



Hostname: echo-758859bbfb-cnfmx
...
```

## Alpha limitations

The KIC Gateway API alpha is a work in progress, and not all features of
Gateway APIs are supported. In particular:

- HTTPRoute is the only supported route type. TCPRoute, UDPRoute, and TLSRoute
  are not yet implemented.
- HTTPRoute does not yet support multiple backendRefs. You cannot distribute
  requests across multiple Services.
- queryParam matches matches are not supported.
