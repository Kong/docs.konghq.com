!!! Only Kong employees can add labels due to a GitHub limitation. If you're an OSS contributor, thank you! The maintainers will label this PR for you !!!

When raising a pull request, it's useful to indicate what type of review you're looking for from the team. To help with this, we've added three labels that can be applied:

    review:copyedit: Request for writer review.
    review:general: Review for general accuracy and presentation. Does the doc work? Does it output correctly?
    review:tech: Request for technical review from an SME.

At least one of these labels must be applied to a PR or the build will fail.
