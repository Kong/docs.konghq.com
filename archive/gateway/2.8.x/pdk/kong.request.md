Client request module.

 This module provides a set of functions to retrieve information about the
 incoming requests made by clients.




## kong.request.get_scheme()

Returns the scheme component of the request's URL.  The returned value is
 normalized to lowercase form.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  A string like `"http"` or `"https"`.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request to https://example.com:1234/v1/movies

kong.request.get_scheme() -- "https"
```



## kong.request.get_host()

Returns the host component of the request's URL, or the value of the
 "Host" header.  The returned value is normalized to lowercase form.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The hostname.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request to https://example.com:1234/v1/movies

kong.request.get_host() -- "example.com"
```



## kong.request.get_port()

Returns the port component of the request's URL.  The value is returned
 as a Lua number.


**Phases**

* certificate, rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `number`:  The port.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request to https://example.com:1234/v1/movies

kong.request.get_port() -- 1234
```



## kong.request.get_forwarded_scheme()

Returns the scheme component of the request's URL, but also considers
 `X-Forwarded-Proto` if it comes from a trusted source.  The returned
 value is normalized to lowercase.

 Whether this function considers `X-Forwarded-Proto` or not depends on
 several Kong configuration parameters:

 * [trusted\_ips](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#trusted_ips)
 * [real\_ip\_header](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_header)
 * [real\_ip\_recursive](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_recursive)

 **Note**: Kong does not offer support for the Forwarded HTTP Extension
 (RFC 7239) since it is not supported by ngx_http_realip_module.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The forwarded scheme.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.request.get_forwarded_scheme() -- "https"
```



## kong.request.get_forwarded_host()

Returns the host component of the request's URL or the value of the "host"
 header.  Unlike `kong.request.get_host()`, this function also considers
 `X-Forwarded-Host` if it comes from a trusted source. The returned value
 is normalized to lowercase.

 Whether this function considers `X-Forwarded-Host` or not depends on
 several Kong configuration parameters:

 * [trusted\_ips](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#trusted_ips)
 * [real\_ip\_header](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_header)
 * [real\_ip\_recursive](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_recursive)

 **Note**: Kong does not offer support for the Forwarded HTTP Extension
 (RFC 7239) since it is not supported by ngx_http_realip_module.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The forwarded host.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.request.get_forwarded_host() -- "example.com"
```



## kong.request.get_forwarded_port()

Returns the port component of the request's URL, but also considers
 `X-Forwarded-Host` if it comes from a trusted source.  The value
 is returned as a Lua number.

 Whether this function considers `X-Forwarded-Proto` or not depends on
 several Kong configuration parameters:

 * [trusted\_ips](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#trusted_ips)
 * [real\_ip\_header](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_header)
 * [real\_ip\_recursive](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_recursive)

 **Note**: Kong does not offer support for the Forwarded HTTP Extension
 (RFC 7239) since it is not supported by ngx_http_realip_module.

 When running Kong behind the L4 port mapping (or forwarding), you can also
 configure:
 * [port\_maps](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#port_maps)

 The `port_maps` configuration parameter enables this function to return the
 port to which the port Kong is listening to is mapped to (in case they differ).


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `number`:  The forwarded port.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.request.get_forwarded_port() -- 1234
```



## kong.request.get_forwarded_path()

Returns the path component of the request's URL, but also considers
 `X-Forwarded-Path` if it comes from a trusted source.  The value
 is returned as a Lua string.

 Whether this function considers `X-Forwarded-Path` or not depends on
 several Kong configuration parameters:

 * [trusted\_ips](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#trusted_ips)
 * [real\_ip\_header](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_header)
 * [real\_ip\_recursive](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_recursive)

 **Note**: Kong does not do any normalization on the request path.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The forwarded path.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.request.get_forwarded_path() -- /path
```



## kong.request.get_forwarded_prefix()

Returns the prefix path component of the request's URL that Kong stripped
 before proxying to upstream.  It also checks if `X-Forwarded-Prefix` comes
 from a trusted source, and uses it as-is when given. The value is returned
 as a Lua string.

 If a trusted `X-Forwarded-Prefix` is not passed, this function must be
 called after Kong has run its router (`access` phase),
 as the Kong router may strip the prefix of the request path. That stripped
 path becomes the return value of this function, unless there is already
 a trusted `X-Forwarded-Prefix` header in the request.

 Whether this function considers `X-Forwarded-Prefix` or not depends on
 several Kong configuration parameters:

 * [trusted\_ips](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#trusted_ips)
 * [real\_ip\_header](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_header)
 * [real\_ip\_recursive](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_recursive)

 **Note**: Kong does not do any normalization on the request path prefix.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string|nil`:  The forwarded path prefix or `nil` if the prefix was
 not stripped.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.request.get_forwarded_prefix() -- /prefix
```



## kong.request.get_http_version()

Returns the HTTP version used by the client in the request as a Lua
 number, returning values such as `1`, `1.1`, `2.0`, or `nil` for
 unrecognized values.

**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `number|nil`:  The HTTP version as a Lua number.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.request.get_http_version() -- 1.1
```



## kong.request.get_method()

Returns the HTTP method of the request.  The value is normalized to
 uppercase.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The request method.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.request.get_method() -- "GET"
```



## kong.request.get_path()

Returns the path component of the request's URL.  It is not normalized in
 any way and does not include the query string.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The path.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request to https://example.com:1234/v1/movies?movie=foo

kong.request.get_path() -- "/v1/movies"
```



## kong.request.get_path_with_query()

Returns the path, including the query string if any.  No
 transformations or normalizations are done.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The path with the query string.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request to https://example.com:1234/v1/movies?movie=foo

kong.request.get_path_with_query() -- "/v1/movies?movie=foo"
```



## kong.request.get_raw_query()

Returns the query component of the request's URL.  It is not normalized in
 any way (not even URL-decoding of special characters) and does not
 include the leading `?` character.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The query component of the request's URL.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request to https://example.com/foo?msg=hello%20world&bla=&bar

kong.request.get_raw_query() -- "msg=hello%20world&bla=&bar"
```



## kong.request.get_query_arg()

Returns the value of the specified argument, obtained from the query
 arguments of the current request.

 The returned value is either a `string`, a boolean `true` if an
 argument was not given a value, or `nil` if no argument with `name` was
 found.

 If an argument with the same name is present multiple times in the
 query string, this function returns the value of the first occurrence.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string|boolean|nil`:  The value of the argument.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request GET /test?foo=hello%20world&bar=baz&zzz&blo=&bar=bla&bar

kong.request.get_query_arg("foo") -- "hello world"
kong.request.get_query_arg("bar") -- "baz"
kong.request.get_query_arg("zzz") -- true
kong.request.get_query_arg("blo") -- ""
```



## kong.request.get_query([max_args])

Returns the table of query arguments obtained from the query string.  Keys
 are query argument names. Values are either a string with the argument
 value, a boolean `true` if an argument was not given a value, or an array
 if an argument was given in the query string multiple times. Keys and
 values are unescaped according to URL-encoded escaping rules.

 Note that a query string `?foo&bar` translates to two boolean `true`
 arguments, and `?foo=&bar=` translates to two string arguments containing
 empty strings.

 By default, this function returns up to **100** arguments. The optional
 `max_args` argument can be specified to customize this limit, but must be
 greater than **1** and not greater than **1000**.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **max_args** (`number`, _optional_):  Sets a limit on the maximum number of parsed
 arguments.

**Returns**

* `table`:  A table representation of the query string.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request GET /test?foo=hello%20world&bar=baz&zzz&blo=&bar=bla&bar

for k, v in pairs(kong.request.get_query()) do
  kong.log.inspect(k, v)
end

-- Will print
-- "foo" "hello world"
-- "bar" {"baz", "bla", true}
-- "zzz" true
-- "blo" ""
```



## kong.request.get_header(name)

Returns the value of the specified request header.

 The returned value is either a `string`, or can be `nil` if a header with
 `name` was not found in the request. If a header with the same name is
 present multiple times in the request, this function returns the value
 of the first occurrence of this header.

 Header names in are case-insensitive and are normalized to lowercase, and
 dashes (`-`) can be written as underscores (`_`); that is, the header
 `X-Custom-Header` can also be retrieved as `x_custom_header`.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **name** (`string`):  the name of the header to be returned

**Returns**

* `string|nil`:  the value of the header or nil if not present


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request with the following headers:

-- Host: foo.com
-- X-Custom-Header: bla
-- X-Another: foo bar
-- X-Another: baz

kong.request.get_header("Host")            -- "foo.com"
kong.request.get_header("x-custom-header") -- "bla"
kong.request.get_header("X-Another")       -- "foo bar"
```



## kong.request.get_headers([max_headers])

Returns a Lua table holding the request headers.  Keys are header names.
 Values are either a string with the header value, or an array of strings
 if a header was sent multiple times. Header names in this table are
 case-insensitive and are normalized to lowercase, and dashes (`-`) can be
 written as underscores (`_`); that is, the header `X-Custom-Header` can
 also be retrieved as `x_custom_header`.

 By default, this function returns up to **100** headers. The optional
 `max_headers` argument can be specified to customize this limit, but must
 be greater than **1** and not greater than **1000**.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **max_headers** (`number`, _optional_):  Sets a limit on the maximum number of
 parsed headers.

**Returns**

* `table`:  The request headers in table form.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a request with the following headers:

-- Host: foo.com
-- X-Custom-Header: bla
-- X-Another: foo bar
-- X-Another: baz
local headers = kong.request.get_headers()

headers.host            -- "foo.com"
headers.x_custom_header -- "bla"
headers.x_another[1]    -- "foo bar"
headers["X-Another"][2] -- "baz"
```



## kong.request.get_raw_body()

Returns the plain request body.

 If the body has no size (empty), this function returns an empty string.

 If the size of the body is greater than the Nginx buffer size (set by
 `client_body_buffer_size`), this function fails and returns an error
 message explaining this limitation.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, response, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The plain request body.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a body with payload "Hello, Earth!":

kong.request.get_raw_body():gsub("Earth", "Mars") -- "Hello, Mars!"
```



## kong.request.get_body([mimetype[, max_args]])

Returns the request data as a key/value table.
 A high-level convenience function.

 The body is parsed with the most appropriate format:

 * If `mimetype` is specified, it decodes the body with the requested
   content type (if supported). This takes precedence over any content type
   present in the request.

   The optional argument `mimetype` can be one of the following strings:
     * `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
     * `application/json`
     * `multipart/form-data`

 Whether `mimetype` is specified or a request content type is otherwise
 present in the request, each content type behaves as follows:

 * If the request content type is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`:
   * Returns the body as form-encoded.
 * If the request content type is `multipart/form-data`:
   * Decodes the body as multipart form data
     (same as `multipart(kong.request.get_raw_body(),
     kong.request.get_header("Content-Type")):get_all()` ).
 * If the request content type is `application/json`:
   * Decodes the body as JSON
     (same as `json.decode(kong.request.get_raw_body())`).
   * JSON types are converted to matching Lua types.
 * If the request contains none of the above and the `mimetype` argument is
   not set, returns `nil` and an error message indicating the
   body could not be parsed.

 The optional argument `max_args` can be used to set a limit on the number
 of form arguments parsed for `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` payloads.

 The third return value is string containing the mimetype used to parsed
 the body (as per the `mimetype` argument), allowing the caller to identify
 what MIME type the body was parsed as.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, response, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **mimetype** (`string`, _optional_):  The MIME type.
* **max_args** (`number`, _optional_):  Sets a limit on the maximum number of parsed
 arguments.

**Returns**

1.  `table|nil`:  A table representation of the body.

1.  `string|nil`:  An error message.

1.  `string|nil`:  mimetype The MIME type used.


**Usage**

``` lua
local body, err, mimetype = kong.request.get_body()
body.name -- "John Doe"
body.age  -- "42"
```
