title: Configuration Reference
---

## Configuration loading

Kong comes with a default configuration file that can be found at
`/etc/kong/kong.conf.default` if you installed Kong via one of the official
packages. To start configuring Kong, you can copy this file:

```bash
$ cp /etc/kong/kong.conf.default /etc/kong/kong.conf
```

Kong will operate with default settings should all the values in your
configuration be commented-out. Upon starting, Kong looks for several
default locations that might contain a configuration file:

```
/etc/kong/kong.conf
/etc/kong.conf
```

You can override this behavior by specifying a custom path for your
configuration file using the `-c / --conf` argument in the CLI:

```bash
$ kong start --conf /path/to/kong.conf
```

The configuration format is straightforward: simply uncomment any property
(comments are defined by the `#` character) and modify it to your needs.
Booleans values can be specified as `on/off` or `true`/`false` for convenience.

## Verifying your configuration

You can verify the integrity of your settings with the `check` command:

```bash
$ kong check <path/to/kong.conf>
configuration at <path/to/kong.conf> is valid
```

This command will take into account the environment variables you have
currently set, and will error out in case your settings are invalid.

Additionally, you can also use the CLI in debug mode to have more insight
as to what properties Kong is being started with:

```bash
$ kong start -c <kong.conf> --vv
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [verbose] no config file found at /etc/kong.conf
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [verbose] no config file found at /etc/kong/kong.conf
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] admin_listen = "0.0.0.0:8001"
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] cluster_listen = "0.0.0.0:7946"
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] cluster_listen_rpc = "127.0.0.1:7373"
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] cluster_profile = "wan"
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] cluster_ttl_on_failure = 3600
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] database = "postgres"
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] log_level = "notice"
[...]
```

## Environment variables

When loading properties out of a configuration file, Kong will also look for
environment variables of the same name. This allows you to fully configure Kong
via environment variables, which is very convenient for container-based
infrastructures, for example.

All environment variables prefixed with `KONG_`, capitalized and bearing the
same name as a setting will override it.

Example:

```
log_level = debug # in kong.conf
```

Can be overridden with:

```bash
$ export KONG_LOG_LEVEL=error
```

## Custom Nginx configuration & embedding Kong

Tweaking the Nginx configuration is an essential part of setting up your Kong
instances since it allows you to optimize its performance for your
infrastructure, or embed Kong in an already running OpenResty instance.

### Custom Nginx configuration

Kong can be started, reloaded and restarted with an `--nginx-conf` argument,
which must specify an Nginx configuration template. Such a template uses the
[Penlight][Penlight] [templating engine][pl.template], which is compiled using
the given Kong configuration, before being dumped in your Kong prefix
directory, moments before starting Nginx.

The default template can be found at:
https://github.com/Kong/kong/tree/master/kong/templates.  It is split in
two Nginx configuration files: `nginx.lua` and `nginx_kong.lua`. The former is
minimalistic and includes the later, which contains everything Kong requires to
run. Moments before starting Nginx, those two files are copied into the prefix
directory, which looks like so:

```
/usr/local/kong
├── nginx-kong.conf
├── nginx.conf
```

If you wish to include other `server` blocks in your Nginx configuration, or if
you must tweak global settings that are not exposed by the Kong configuration,
here is a suggestion:

```
# ---------------------
# custom_nginx.template
# ---------------------

worker_processes ${{ "{{NGINX_WORKER_PROCESSES" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf
daemon ${{ "{{NGINX_DAEMON" }}}};                     # can be set by kong.conf

pid pids/nginx.pid;                      # this setting is mandatory
error_log logs/error.log ${{ "{{LOG_LEVEL" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf

events {
    use epoll; # custom setting
    multi_accept on;
}

http {
    # include default Kong Nginx config
    include 'nginx-kong.conf';

    # custom server
    server {
        listen 8888;
        server_name custom_server;

        location / {
          ... # etc
        }
    }
}
```

You can then start Kong with:

```bash
$ kong start -c kong.conf --nginx-conf custom_nginx.template
```

If you wish to customize the Kong Nginx sub-configuration file to, eventually,
add other Lua handlers or customize the `lua_*` directives, you can inline the
`nginx_kong.lua` configuration in this `custom_nginx.template` example file:

```
# ---------------------
# custom_nginx.template
# ---------------------

worker_processes ${{ "{{NGINX_WORKER_PROCESSES" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf
daemon ${{ "{{NGINX_DAEMON" }}}};                     # can be set by kong.conf

pid pids/nginx.pid;                      # this setting is mandatory
error_log logs/error.log ${{ "{{LOG_LEVEL" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf

events {}

http {
  resolver ${{ "{{DNS_RESOLVER" }}}} ipv6=off;
  charset UTF-8;
  error_log logs/error.log ${{ "{{LOG_LEVEL" }}}};
  access_log logs/access.log;

  ... # etc
}
```

### Serving both a website and your APIs from Kong

A common use case for API providers is to make Kong serve both a website
and the APIs themselves over the Proxy port &mdash; `80` or `443` in
production. For example, `https://my-api.com` (Website) and
`https://my-api.com/api/v1` (API).

To achieve this, we cannot simply declare a new virtual server block,
like we did in the previous section. A good solution is to use a custom
Nginx configuration template which inlines `nginx_kong.lua` and adds a new
`location` block serving the website alongside the Kong Proxy `location`
block:

```
# ---------------------
# custom_nginx.template
# ---------------------

worker_processes ${{ "{{NGINX_WORKER_PROCESSES" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf
daemon ${{ "{{NGINX_DAEMON" }}}};                     # can be set by kong.conf

pid pids/nginx.pid;                      # this setting is mandatory
error_log logs/error.log ${{ "{{LOG_LEVEL" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf
events {}

http {
  # here, we inline the contents of nginx_kong.lua
  charset UTF-8;

  # any contents until Kong's Proxy server block
  ...

  # Kong's Proxy server block
  server {
    server_name kong;

    # any contents until the location / block
    ...

    # here, we declare our custom location serving our website
    # (or API portal) which we can optimize for serving static assets
    location / {
      root /var/www/my-api.com;
      index index.htm index.html;
      ...
    }

    # Kong's Proxy location / has been changed to /api/v1
    location /api/v1 {
      set $upstream_host nil;
      set $upstream_scheme nil;
      set $upstream_uri nil;

      # Any remaining configuration for the Proxy location
      ...
    }
  }

  # Kong's Admin server block goes below
}
```

### Embed Kong in OpenResty

If you are running your own OpenResty servers, you can also easily embed Kong
by including the Kong Nginx sub-configuration using the `include` directive
(similar to the examples of the previous section). However, you will need the
final configuration and not the template. For this, use the `compile` command,
which outputs a fully-compiled Nginx sub-configuration to `stdout`:

```bash
$ bin/kong compile --conf kong.conf > /usr/local/openresty/conf/nginx-kong.conf

# now start OpenResty with a configuration that "includes" nginx-kong.conf
$ nginx -c /usr/local/openresty/conf/nginx.conf
```

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> When embedding Kong this way, you will have to
  ensure the required third-party services are already running and configured
  correctly according to the kong.conf used to compile the Nginx
  sub-configuration. This includes the database, and serf.

### Datastore section

Kong will store all of its data (such as APIs, Consumers and Plugins) in
either Cassandra or PostgreSQL.

All Kong nodes belonging to the same cluster must connect themselves to the
same database.

---

#### database

Determines which of PostgreSQL or Cassandra this node will use as its
datastore. Accepted values are `postgres` and `cassandra`.

Default: `postgres`

---

### Clustering section

In addition to pointing to the same database, each Kong node must join the
same cluster.

Kong's clustering works on the IP layer (hostnames are not supported, only
IPs) and expects a flat network topology without any NAT between the
datacenters.

A common pattern is to create a VPN between the two datacenters such that
the flat network assumption is not violated.

See the clustering reference for more information:
https://docs.konghq.com/latest/clustering/

---

#### cluster_listen

Address and port used to communicate with other nodes in the cluster.
All other Kong nodes in the same cluster must be able to communicate over both
TCP and UDP on this address. Only IPv4 addresses are supported.

Default: `0.0.0.0:7946`

---

#### cluster_listen_rpc

Address and port used to communicate with the cluster through the agent
running on this node. Only contains TCP traffic local to this node.

Default: `127.0.0.1:7373`

---

#### cluster_advertise

By default, the `cluster_listen` address is advertised over the cluster.
If the `cluster_listen` host is '0.0.0.0', then the first local, non-loopback
IPv4 address will be advertised to other nodes.
However, in some cases (specifically NAT traversal), there may be a routable
address that cannot be bound to. This flag enables advertising a different
address to support this.

Default: none

---

#### cluster_encrypt_key

Base64-encoded 16-bytes key to encrypt cluster traffic with.

Default: none

---

#### cluster_keyring_file

Specifies a file to load keyring data from.
Kong is able to keep encryption keys in sync
and perform key rotations. During a key
rotation, there may be some period of time in
which Kong is required to maintain more than
one encryption key until all members have
received the new key.

Default: none

---

#### cluster_ttl_on_failure

Time to live (in seconds) of a node in the cluster when it stops sending
healthcheck pings, possibly caused by a node or network failure.
If a node is not able to send a new healthcheck ping before the expiration,
other nodes in the cluster will stop attempting to connect to it.

Recommended to be at least `60`.

Default: `3600`

---

#### cluster_profile

The timing profile for inter-cluster pings and timeouts. If a `lan` or `local`
profile is used over the Internet, a high rate of failures is risked as the
timing constraints would be too tight.

Accepted values are `local`, `lan`, `wan`.

Default: `wan`

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

### DNS resolver section

Kong will resolve hostnames as either `SRV` or `A` records (in that order, and
`CNAME` records will be dereferenced in the process).
In case a name was resolved as an `SRV` record it will also override any given
port number by the `port` field contents received from the dns server.

For the duration of the `ttl`, the internal dns resolver will loadbalance each
request it gets over the entries in the dns record. For `SRV` records the
`weight` fields will be honored, but it will only use the lowest `priority`
field entries in the record.

---

#### dns_resolver

Comma separated list of nameservers, each
entry in `ipv4[:port]` format to be used by
Kong. If not specified the nameservers in
the local `resolv.conf` file will be used.
Port defaults to 53 if omitted.

Default: none

---

#### dns_hostsfile

The hosts file to use. This file is read once and its content is static
in memory. To read the file again after modifying it, Kong must be reloaded.

Default: `/etc/hosts`

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

### Development & miscellaneous section

Additional settings inherited from lua-nginx-module allowing for more
flexibility and advanced usage.

See the lua-nginx-module documentation for more information:
https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module

---

#### lua_ssl_trusted_certificate

Absolute path to the certificate authority file for Lua cosockets in PEM
format. This certificate will be the one used for verifying Kong's database
connections, when `pg_ssl_verify` or `cassandra_ssl_verify` are enabled.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_trusted_certificate

Default: none

---

#### lua_ssl_verify_depth

Sets the verification depth in the server certificates chain used by Lua
cosockets, set by `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate`.

This includes the certificates configured for Kong's database connections.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_verify_depth

Default: `1`

---

#### lua_code_cache

When disabled, every request will run in a separate Lua VM instance: all Lua
modules will be loaded from scratch. Useful for adopting an edit-and-refresh
approach while developing a plugin.

Turning this directive off has a severe impact on performance.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_code_cache

Default: `on`

---

#### lua_package_path

Sets the Lua module search path (LUA_PATH). Useful when developing or using
custom plugins not stored in the default search path.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path

Default: none

---

#### lua_package_cpath

Sets the Lua C module search path (LUA_CPATH).

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_cpath

Default: none

---

#### lua_socket_pool_size

Specifies the size limit for every cosocket connection pool associated with
every remote server.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_socket_pool_size

Default: `30`
