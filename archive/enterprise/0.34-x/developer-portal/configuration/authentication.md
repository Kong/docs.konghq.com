title: Authenticating the Dev Portal
---

## Supported Authentication Plugins

The Dev Portal supports the following authentication plugins:

* [Basic Auth](/hub/kong-inc/basic-auth/)
* [Key Authentication](/plugins/key-authentication)
* [OpenID Connect-EE](/plugins/ee-openid-connect/)


## Enable Authentication

To enable authentication for a Dev Portal, navigate to the *settings* page for 
that Dev Portal in the `Kong Manager` and select one of the authentcation 
plugins from the drop down list. Upon save the Dev Portal will refresh and use 
the newly supplised authentication plugin.
 
The Dev Portal config can also be patched directly:

```
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/workspaces/<WORKSPACE NAME> \
  --data "config.portal_auth=basic-auth"
```


## Set a default authentication plugin

A default authentication plugin can be set in the Kong Configuration file under 
`portal_auth`. When this variable is set, all Dev Portals will use this 
authentication plugin unless that Dev Portal's setting are manually overridden. 


## Developer Registration

Developers are now able to request access to the Dev Portal via the 
`unauthenticated/register` partial. Any `<input />` field inside this partial 
will be submitted to the `http://127.0.0.1:8000/_kong/portal/register` endpoint 
and a Developer credential is created upon registration. The Developer will not 
be able to use this credential until they are approved. See 
[Approving Developers](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/developer-portal/management/developers/#developer-status).


Required Registration fields by Authentication plugin:

  - Basic Authentication: 

      ```html
      <input type="text" name="email" required />
      <input type="password" name="password" required />
      ```

  - Key Authentication: 

      ```html
      <input type="text" name="email" required />
      <input type="text" name="key" required />
      ```

  - Open-ID Connect:

      ```html
      <input type="text" name="email" required />
      ```
> **Note:** All plugins require the email input since Developers will register 
>and be unique by email.


### Collecting More Data on Registration

Additional information can be stored for the Developer inside the `meta` data 
attribute. This field is stored in the Kong datastore on the Developer entity 
and will be visible to Kong Admins. 

The default Dev Portal theme demonstrates this through the "full_name" input: 

```html
<input type="text" name="full_name" required />
```

This can be customized to gather more information information (e.g. 
"referral source", "phone-number", "company", "team" etc.) Meta tags are stored 
in plain text, so be careful not to store sensitive information in meta.


## Example configurations

### Basic Authentication

Check out the section "**Enabling Authentication"** for a step by step guide on 
setting up 
[Basic Authentication](/plugins/basic-authentication).

### Key Authentication

The [Key Authentication Plugin](/plugins/key-authentication) 
allows developers to use API keys to authenticate requests, and can be used to 
authenticate the Dev Portal. Developers will be able to login with a single API 
key, rather than a username/password.

In the Dev Portal's settings in `Kong Manager` select `Key Auth` from the 
Authentication Plugin dropdown, or run the following cURL command:

```
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/workspaces/<WORKSPACE NAME> \
  --data "config.portal_auth=key-auth"
```


### Open-ID Connect Plugin

The [OpenID Connect Plugin](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/) 
allows the Dev Portal to hook into existing authentication setups using third-party 
*Identity Providers* (**IdP**) such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft Azure AD, etc. 

[OIDC](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/) must be used with 
the `session` method, utilizing cookies for Dev Portal File API requests.

In the Dev Portal's settings in `Kong Manager` select `Open ID Connect` from the 
Authentication Plugin dropdown, or run the following cURL command:

```
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/workspaces/<WORKSPACE NAME> \
  --data "config.portal_auth=openid-connect"
```

Add the `openid-connect` configuration to `plugin config` JSON field using valid
 [JSON](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON). 
 Here is an example configuration:

```
portal_auth_conf = {                                               \
  "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com/",                        \
  "client_id": "<ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>",                      \
  "client_secret": "<ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>",              \
  "consumer_by": "username,custom_id,id",                          \
  "ssl_verify": "false",                                           \
  "consumer_claim": "email",                                       \
  "leeway": "1000",                                                \
  "login_action": "redirect",                                      \
  "login_redirect_mode": "query",                                  \
  "login_redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:8003",                   \
  "forbidden_redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:8003/unauthorized",  \
  "logout_methods": "GET",                                         \
  "logout_query_arg": "logout",                                    \
  "logout_redirect_uri": "http://127.0.0.1:8003",                  \
  "scopes": "openid,profile,email,offline_access"                  \
}
```

The values above can be replaced with their corresponding values for a custom 
OIDC configuration:

  - `<ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE>` - Client ID provided by IdP
        * For Example, Google credentials can be found here: 
        https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials
  - `<ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE>` - Client secret provided by IdP

</video>

By default the Example Dev Portal comes with a "Sign in with Google" button, but 
this can be overriden in the `unauthenticated/login` partial. See 
[Customize Your Login Form](#customize-your-login-form)

Browse to the login page (see section [Logging In](#logging-in)). Click
 
 "Sign in with Google" which will take you to the Google login page. Once logged 
 in, Google will redirect you back to the Example Dev Portal and all requests 
 going forward will have the associated authentication session cookie. The 
 Default Dev Portal and the OIDC configuration above will provide an `id_token` 
 which will be used to display a Developer's avatar.


## Logging In

Ensure you are logged out (see section [Logging Out](#logging-out)). Visit an 
authenticated page on the Dev Portal. You should see a login form, which is 
rendered from the `unauthenticated/login` partial. 

When a Developer submits an HTML form with an attribute `id="login"` the Dev 
Portal will make a request against the Dev Portal File API using the specified 
`portal_auth` with the data in the form. For instance, if you have `basic-auth` 
enabled, then the form will submit with the Authorization header e.g.
 `Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=`. If the Login returns a 
 response with a status code that is not `200`, then it runs `onLoginError`.


### Customize Your Login Form

The Example Dev Portal provides the `partials/unauthenticated/login.hbs` file 
and **is required** to exist in order for authentication functionality to work. 
This partial is rendered when a developer attempts to access a page they do not 
have access to. You can customize this page's styles or add/update any marketing 
copy, but the `<input />` elements are required when using 
[Basic Authentication](#basic-authentication) or 
[Key Authentication](#key-authentication).


## Logging Out üëãüèª

Any element with `id="logout"` on click will clear the Local Storage 
authentication data, for example:

```html
<button id="logout">Logout</button>
```

> **Note:** When using `openid-connect`, developers will be redirected to 
>`<PORTAL_API_URI>?logout=true`, clearing the session cookie. This config should 
>be set inside the openid-connect plugin configuration inside `portal_auth_conf`. 
>See the section on 
>[configuring the Open-ID Connect Plugin](#open-id-connect-plugin)


## How To: Understanding Dev Portal Routing & Authentication

![alt text](https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/dev_portal_auth_flow.png "Auth Routing Diagram")

The Dev Portal router runs through a series of steps to determine which files to 
serve based on the user's authentication status. Let's explore how the Dev 
Portal router handles authentication by playing with an instance of the Example 
Dev Portal.

Before we start, check that you:

1. Have an instance of the Example Dev Portal running (see **Getting Started**)
2. Authentication is enabled and configured (see **Authentication > Getting Started**)

Lets first create two test pages that will simply illustrate whether we are 
viewing an authenticated or unauthenticated page.

1.  `pages/test.hbs`
    1. Create a file named `pages/test.hbs` and open it in your favorite text 
    editor.
    2. Insert the code below into the file and save:

        ```html
        <h1>This is an authenticated test page</h1>
        ```

    3. Upload `pages/test.hbs` to the Dev Portal File API in the `Kong Manager` 
    or with the following command:
       
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/files \
             -F "name=test" \
             -F "type=page" \
             -F "contents=@pages/test.hbs" \
             -F "auth=true"
        ```

    4. Navigate to [`:8003/default/test`](http://127.0.0.1:8003/default/test) 
    and ensure that the browser looks like this:
    
    ![alt text](https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unauthed-message.png "Authenticated Page")

2. `pages/unauthenticated/test.hbs`
   1. Create a file named `pages/unauthenticated/test.hbs` and open it in your 
   favorite text editor.
   2. Insert the code below into the file and save:

        ```html
        <h1>This is an unauthenticated test page</h1>
        ```
   3. Upload `pages/unauthenticated/test.hbs` to the Dev Portal File API in the 
   `Kong Manager` or with the following command:
      
        ```bash
        curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/files \
              -F "name=unauthenticated/test" \
              -F "type=page" \
              -F "contents=@pages/unauthenticated/test.hbs" \
              -F "auth=false"
        ```

    4. Navigate to 
    [`:8003/unauthenticated`](http://127.0.0.1:8003/default/unauthenticated/test) 
    test and ensure that the browser looks like this:
    
     ![alt text](https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/unauthed-message2.png "Unauthenticated Page")

Now that we have created our two test pages, let's take a look at how the Dev 
Portal deals with authenticated/unauthenticated routes.

**Authenticated Flow:**

1. If you are not already, login to the Example Dev Portal (see section 
[Logging In](#logging-in)).
2. Navigate to [:8003/test](http://127.0.0.1:8003/default/test) in your browser, 
you should see a header stating *"This is an authenticated test page".*
    1. The Dev Portal went through the following flow:
        1. Search for a page named **test** *There is!*
        2. Check to ensure that you have authorization to access the page. *You do!*
        3. Serve **test** page to the browser.

> **Note:** You can still access the unauthenticated test page by navigating to 
>[:8003/unauthenticated/test](http://127.0.0.1:8003/default/unauthenticated/test) 
>in the browser.

**Unauthenticated Flow:**

1. If you have not already, log out of the Dev Portal (see section 
[Logging Out](#logging-out)).
2. Navigate to [:8003/test](http://127.0.0.1:8003/default/test) in your browser, 
you should see text stating *"This is an unauthenticated test page"*.
3. Notice that although the path **/test** requests `test.hbs` (our 
authenticated page), we are served `unauthenticated/test.hbs`.
    1. The Dev Portal went through the following flow:
        1. Parse the path `/test` to determine we would like to serve a page 
        named **test**.
        1. Search for a page named **test**. *There is!*
        1. Ensure that you have authorization to access the page. 
        *You don't. You are not currently logged in and the page requires authentication.*
        1. Check to see if there is a page named **unauthenticated/test**. *There is!*
        1. Ensure that you have authorization to access the page. *You do!*
        1. Serve the **unauthenticated/test** page to the browser.

> **Note:** As illustrated by the above example, when a user requests a 
>particular page to access that they are not authorized to view, the Dev Portal 
>will check for the same filename under the 'unauthenticated' namespace to serve 
>instead. For this reason the 'unauthenticated' namespace is reserved, and 
>should be used explicitly for authentication

> **Note pt. 2:** Requesting a page while unauthenticated that both requires 
>auth, and does not have a corresponding page under the 'unauthenticated' 
>namespace will result in a 404.  You can test this by requesting pages like 
>[:8003/guides](http://127.0.0.1:8003/default/guides) or 
>[:8003/about](http://127.0.0.1:8003/default/about) while unauthenticated.

## JavaScript hooks

You can find these functions in the `unauthenticated/auth-js` partial in the 
Example Dev Portal. They allow you to hook into the Dev Portal authentication 
behavior through javascript functions.

**onLoginError**

Customize how your form submit will handle errors, as well as customize default 
error messages:

```js
/*
 * When a user attempts to log in, but authentication fails.
 */
function onLoginError(error) {
  var resp = error.response
  var errorMessages = {
  // Note: Approved developers will not receive an error, so this is
  // here only for status type documentation purposes.
  // 0: {
  //  status: 'approved',
  //  message: ""
  // },
    1: {
      status: 'requested',
      message: "You have requested access, but your account is pending approval."
    },
    2: {
      status: 'rejected',
      message: "This account has been rejected."
    },
    3: {
      status: 'revoked',
      message: "This account has been revoked."
    }
  }
  
  /**
   *  Parse error response and utilize Kong function getMessageFromError helper
   */
  var errorMessage = errorMessages[resp.data.status] 
                       && errorMessages[resp.data.status].message 
                       || window.getMessageFromError(error)
  alert('Login failed. ' + errorMessage)
}

/* 
 * When a user attempts to register, but registration fails.
 */
function onRegistrationError(error) {
  alert('Registration failed. ' + window.getMessageFromError(error))
}

/**
 * When a user registers successfully, you can customize
 * where they are redirected. By default, they are redirected
 * to the index route '/', PORTAL_GUI_URL
*/
function onRegistrationSuccess() {
  alert('Thank you for registering! Your request will be reviewed.')
  window.navigateToHome() // Navigates to PORTAL_GUI_URL
}
```

## How Authentication is Stored in Local Storage

The Dev Portal uses the 
[Local Storage API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Web/API/Window/localStorage) 
to store and retrieve Authentication credentials, parameters, and headers. 
Local Storage is saved on every successful login, and it is retrieved on every 
Dev Portal File API request based the `auth-store-types` value, until you 
[logout](#logging-out). 

> **IMPORTANT**: Local Storage Authentication credentials are stored in the 
>browser via base64-encoding, but are not encrypted. Any javascript executed on 
>the same domain as your Dev Portal can access these values so it advised that 
>you always used SSL/TLS and either use openid-connect to secure your Dev Portal 
>(as it uses javascript inaccessible HTTP-only encrypted cookies), or limit the 
>amount of third-party javascript injected on your Dev Portal to prevent 
>[XSS vulnerabilities](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting).

> **Note:** Openid-connect uses cookies to persist authentication, and therefore 
>does not use Local Storage.
