## Enable the Dev Portal

1. Open the Kong configuration file in your editor of choice (`kong.conf`)
2. Find and change the `portal` configuration option to `on` Don't forget to remove the `#` from the beginning of the line, it should now look like: `portal = on`.
    - Enables the **Dev Portal Files endpoint** on Admin API which can be accessed at: `:8001/files`
    - Enables the **Public Dev Portal Files API** which can be accessed at `:8004/files`
    - Serves the **Dev Portal Loader** on port `:8003`
3. Restart Kong (`kong restart`)

> Note: Not all deployments of Kong utilize a configuration file, if this describes you (or you are unsure) please reference the [Kong configuration docs](/0.13.x/configuration/) in order to implement this step.

## Visit the Example Dev Portal

Now that you have enabled the Dev Portal in Kong, you can visit the Example Dev Portal:

* Navigate your browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8003`

You should now see the Default Dev Portal Homepage, and be able to navigate through the example pages.
