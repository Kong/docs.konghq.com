# Introduction

Welcome to the 1.1.0 release of Kong Studio. In this release we focused on 
improving the editing experience and addressing some feedback from the previous 
release.

# Whatâ€™s New?

## Live Preview

You can now preview a visual form of your OpenAPI spec as you edit directly from 
inside Kong Studio. It is a separate pane to the right of the editor that can be 
shown / hidden from view as you edit. Live Preview makes it easier to see whether 
changes are valid, and give a better idea of the final output.

## Improved Editor Navigation

We fixed many issues with the Editor Navigation. Editor Navigation now fully 
supports arrays and objects. A full list of fixes can be found below under the 
Fixed issues list.

## Improved Activity Bar

Weâ€™ve updated the Activity Bar with a refreshed look and new icons to improve 
navigation. Now itâ€™s easier to tell where, and what activity youâ€™re on from a 
glance.

## Kong Studio Dark Theme

One of the great things about Kong Studio is themes, with the initial release we 
had a dedicated Kong Studio Light theme. Now, with the second release comes the 
official Kong Studio Dark Theme. âœ¨

You can set your theme by: **Application > Preferences (CTRL+, or CMD+,) > Themes > Studio Dark**

## Import by Clipboard

It is now even easier to import data into Studio directly from your clipboard. 
This one comes directly from an Insomnia open source contribution! ðŸ¤—
