            Next, apply the `%{kong_plugin}` resource to an ingress by annotating the `%{kong_consumer}` object as follows:
          replace_consumer_name_with: |
            Replace `%{consumer_name}` with the name of the consumer that this plugin configuration will target.
            You can see your available consumers by running `%{command}`.

            The %{kong_plugin} resource only needs to be defined once
            and can be applied to any service, consumer, or route in the namespace. If you
            want the plugin to be available cluster-wide, create the resource as a
            <code>%{kong_cluster_plugin}</code> instead of <code>%{kong_plugin}</code>.
