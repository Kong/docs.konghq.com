<!-- 
Introduce your plugin with a long description. What does it do, and why would someone want to use it? 

If this is an Enterprise version of an open-source plugin, explain what benefits the 
plugin adds over the free version.

For example: 

    Use the Mocking plugin to provide mock endpoints to test your APIs in development against your services.
    The plugin leverages standards based on the Open API Specification (OAS)
    for sending out mock responses to APIs. Mocking supports both Swagger 2.0 and OpenAPI 3.0.

    Benefits of service mocking with the Kong Mocking plugin:

    - Conforms to a design-first approach since mock responses are within OAS.
    - Accelerates development of services and APIs.
