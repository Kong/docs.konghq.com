Reference topics describe the technology. For example, a document that describes the different command line or API options. Reference material should not explain basic concepts or how to accomplish a task. You can add links to explanation articles if needed.

You can optionally start a reference topic with a 1-2 sentence introduction. An introduction to a reference topic explains what the reference is documenting, but doesn't go into background detail.

## First section <!-- Header optional if there's only one section in the article -->

You can use sections to break the reference material into categories. For example, if you were writing an API reference, one section could be about identity management APIs and another section could be about authentication APIs. Section titles should be a noun or nouns that explain the content in the section. For example, "Identity management" or "Authentication".

Tables are common in reference material:

| Term      | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|Example | Example |
|Example | Example |

You can also use bulleted lists and paragraphs to describe. For example, you could describe what happens when you enable a certain feature:

* If ___ is also enabled, then...
* The time parameter is used to...

## Second section <!-- Optional -->

If you have more subtopics or categories about your main topic, you can keep adding headers and sections until you've completed your doc. 

## See also <!-- Optional -->

This section should include a list of tutorials or how-to guides that a user can visit to extend their learning from this reference article.
