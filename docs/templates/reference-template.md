Reference topics describe the technology. For example, a reference could be a document that describes the different command line or API options. Reference material should not explain basic concepts or how to accomplish a task. You can add links to explanation articles if needed.

You can optionally start a reference topic with a 1-2 sentence introduction. An introduction to a reference topic explains what the reference is documenting, but doesn't go into background detail. It can link off to an explanation topic for more detail on a related subject.

For example:
"Reference for Kong Gateway configuration parameters. Set these parameters in `kong.conf`.

To learn more about the kong.conf file, see the guide on the [Kong Configuration File](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.0.x/production/kong-conf)."

## First section <!-- Header optional if there's only one section in the article -->

You can use sections to break the reference material into categories. For example, if you were writing an API reference, one section could be about identity management APIs and another section could be about authentication APIs. Section titles should be a noun or nouns that explain the content in the section. For example, "Identity management" or "Authentication".

Tables are common in reference material:

| Term      | Definition |
| --------- | ---------- |
|Example | Example |
|Example | Example |

You can also use bulleted lists and paragraphs for longer descriptions. For example, you could describe what happens when you enable a certain feature:

* If ___ is also enabled, then...
* The time parameter is used to...

{:.note}
> **Note**: You can also use notes to highlight important information. Try to keep them short.

## Second section <!-- Optional -->

If you have more subtopics or categories about your main topic, you can keep adding headers and sections until you've completed your doc. 

## See also <!-- Optional -->

This section should include a list of tutorials or how-to guides that a user can visit to extend their learning from this reference article.
