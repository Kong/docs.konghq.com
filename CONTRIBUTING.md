## Where to report bugs?

If the bug is about the https://docs.konghq.com website itself, please report it
in this [repository's issues
tracker](https://github.com/kong/docs.konghq.com/issues/new).

If the bug is related to Kong itself, please refer to the [Kong Contributing
Guideline](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#where-to-report-bugs)
instead.

## Contributing to Kong documentation and the Kong Hub

Improving the documentation is a most welcome form of contribution to the Kong
community! You are encouraged to suggest edits, improvements, or fix any typo
you may find on this website. Please read the below section about
[submitting a patch](#submitting-a-patch).

Adding and improving listings in the Kong Hub is also encouraged! Please
read the below section
about [Kong Hub contributions](#kong-hub-contributions).

If you wish to contribute to Kong itself (as opposed to the documentation
website), then please consult the [Kong Contributing
Guideline](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing)
instead.

When contributing, be aware of a few things:

- Documentation for Kong Hub listings, which includes all Kong Inc.-published
  and community-published plugins and integrations lives in the `app/_hub`
  and `app/_data/extensions` directories. **Versioning is optional, and thus potentially inconsistent, for this part of the documentation**.
- Kong documentation lives in `app/x.x.x` and Kong Enterprise documentation
  lives in `app/enterprise/`. **These parts of the documentation are versioned**.
  When proposing a change in these parts of the documentation, consider proposing
  the change for older versions as well.
  Example: if you fix a typo in `app/docs/0.10.x/configuration.md`, this typo
  may also be present in `app/docs/0.9.x/configuration.md`.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Kong's Technical Writing Guide & Style Guide

To ensure consistency throughout all of Kong's documentation, we ask that all contributors reference our [Technical Writing Guide ](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/master/TECHNICAL-WRITING-GUIDE.md) and [Style Guide](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/master/STYLEGUIDE.md).

### Submitting a patch

Feel free to contribute fixes or minor features, we love to receive Pull
Requests! If you are planning to develop a larger feature, come talk to us
first in [Kong Nation](https://discuss.konghq.com/).

When contributing, please follow the guidelines provided in this document. They
will cover topics such as the commit message format to use or how to run the
linter.

Once you have read them, and you are ready to submit your Pull Request, be sure
to verify a few things:

- Your commit history is clean: changes are atomic and the git message format
  was respected
- Rebase your work on top of the base branch (seek help online on how to use
  `git rebase`; this is important to ensure your commit history is clean and
   linear)
- The linting is succeeding: run `npm run test` (see the development
  documentation for additional details).
  _Note: The linter won't catch most errors in Plugin Hub documentation. You
  need to check for any errors manually, with a [local build](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)._

If the above guidelines are respected, your Pull Request has all its chances
to be considered and will be reviewed by a maintainer.

If you are asked to update your patch by a reviewer, please do so! Remember:
**you are responsible for pushing your patch forward**. If you contributed it,
you are probably the one in need of it. You must be prepared to apply changes
to it if necessary.

If your Pull Request was accepted, congratulations! You are now an official
contributor of docs.konghq.com and member of the Kong community.

Your changes will be deployed as soon as a maintainer gets a chance to trigger
a build, which should generally happen right after your patch was merged.

### Kong Hub contributions

If you are planning on producing a new Kong plugin or integration, with the
intent to list it in the Kong Hub, let us know! Email Gayle Neumann, Documentation Manager at gayle.neumann@konghq.com, to inform us that you are submitting a plugin or if you have any questions.

Adding a new listing to the Kong Hub may be proposed by:

1. Clone this repo
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com.git
    ```
2. Move into the repo's directory
    ```
    cd docs.konghq.com
    ```
1. Create a [separate branch from master](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches)
    ```
    git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]
    ```
1. Create a publisher directory at`_app/_hub/`, such as
 `_app/_hub/your-GitHub-handle` (if you are contributing as an individual)
 or `_app/_hub/company-name` (if you are contributing as a company). See other Kong Hub listings for examples of publisher names.
1. Create a subdirectory for your extension within your publisher directory -
such as `_app/_hub/your-name/your-extension`.
1. Copy the `/app/_hub/_init/my-extension/index.md` file into your extension's
subdirectory. If you are publishing a single version of your extension, which is typical to
start with, then the file name `index.md` should remain.
1. Edit your `index.md` file based on the guidance in comments in that file -
you'll find lots of helpful examples in other extension files. If you are
documenting a Kong plugin, be sure to see the next section.
1. Custom logos are required for publication on the Kong plugin hub. Custom logos 
should be a square-format PNG file, 
with no transparency, and 120x120 pixels in size. Add the logo file to
`/app/_assets/images/icons/hub/` - the filename of your image should be
`publisher_extension` using the "publisher" and "extension" name from step 2.
1. Be sure to run the docs site locally per the instructions in
the README - you should find your Hub contribution listed at
`localhost:3000/hub`
1. Once you are happy with your listing, push your branch to the GitHub repository
  ```
  git push --set-upstream origin [name_of_your_new_branch]
  ```
1. Find [your branch](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/branches/yours) and make [a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) to add your documentation to the Kong Hub. [Having trouble, or have questions?](#where-to-seek-help)

Kong staff will review your PR, suggest improvements and adjustments as
necessary, and once approved, will merge and deploy your Kong Hub addition!

### Writing plugin documentation

Plugins are documented as extensions under `app/_hub/` - please look at
the existing plugins for examples, and see additional advice in
`app/_hub/_init/my-extension/index.md`.

* `description` - text to be added in the Description section. Use YAML's
  [pipe notation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15540635/what-is-the-use-of-pipe-symbol-in-yaml)
  to write multi-paragraph text. Note that due to the order that data
  is generated, you may not use forward-references in links (e.g. use
  `[example](http://example.com)` and not `[example][example]` pointing to
  an index at the end).
* `desc` (string, required) - a short, one-line description of the extension.
* `type` (array, required) - what kind of extension this is: `plugin` or
`integration` are supported at this time, though more types will be considered.
* `params`
  * `name` - the name of the plugin as it is referred to in Kong's config and Kong's
  Admin API (not always the same spelling as the page name)
  * `api_id` - boolean - whether this plugin can be applied to an API.
  Affects the generation of examples and config table.
  * `route_id` - boolean - whether this plugin can be applied to a Route.
  Affects the generation of examples and config table.
  * `service_id` - boolean - whether this plugin can be applied to a Service.
  Affects the generation of examples and config table.
  * `consumer_id` - boolean - whether this plugin can be applied to a Consumer.
  Affects the generation of examples and config table.
  * `config` - the configuration table.
  Each entry is a configuration item with the following fields:
    * `name` - the field name as read by Kong
    * `required` - `true` if required, `false` if optional, `semi`
    if semi-required (required depending on other fields)
    * `default` - the default value. If using Markdown
    (e.g. to make values appear type-written), wrap it in double-quotes like
    ``"`foobar`"``
    * `value_in_examples` - if the field is to appear in examples, this is
    the value to use. A required field with no `value_in_examples` entry
    will resort to the one in `default`.
    * `description` - description of the field.
    Use YAML's pipe notation if writing longer Markdown text.

### Git Best Practices

#### Git branches

In this repository, `master` represents the current state of the website, and
should constantly be deployed. Branch off of this branch for local development.

If you have write access to the GitHub repository, please follow the following
naming scheme when pushing your branch(es):

- `docs/<ce|ee>-foo-bar` for updates to contents of the documentation (Markdown
  files), README.md, or this file
- `feat/foo-bar` for new website features e.g. Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, or CSS
  changes to support a new feature
- `fix/foo-bar` for website bug fixes (**not** including typos and other fixes
  to the documentation itself, see the [Type](#type) section below)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)


#### Commit atomicity

When submitting patches, you must organize your commits in
logical units of work. You are free to propose a patch with one or many
commits, as long as their atomicity is respected. This means that no unrelated
changes should be included in a commit.

For example, you are writing a patch to fix a bug, but in your endeavor, you
spot another bug. **Do not fix both bugs in the same commit!**. Finish your
work on the initial bug, propose your patch, and come back to the second bug
later on. This is also valid for unrelated style fixes, refactorings, etc...

You should use your best judgment when facing such decisions. A good approach
for this is to put yourself in the shoes of the person who will review your
patch: will they understand your changes and reasoning just by reading your
commit history? Will they find unrelated changes in a particular commit? They
shouldn't!

Writing meaningful commit messages that follow our commit message format will
also help you respect this mantra (see the below section).

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)


#### Commit message format

To maintain a healthy Git history, we ask of you that you write your commit
messages as follows:

- The tense of your message must be **present**
- Your message must be prefixed by a type, and a scope
- The header of your message should not be longer than 50 characters
- A blank line should be included between the header and the body
- The body of your message should not contain lines longer than 72 characters

Here is a template of what your commit message should look like:

```
<type>(<scope>) <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```


##### Type

The type of your commit indicates what type of change this commit is about. The
accepted types are:

- **docs**: Changes made to any static content files associated with Kong, Kong
  Enterprise, and Kong Hub documentation (including typo fixes),
  the README.md or this file
- **feat**: A new website feature e.g. Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, or CSS changes
  to support a new feature
- **fix**: A website bug fix (related to the Ruby, JavaScript, HTML, or CSS
  assets). Typos and other fixes to the _contents_ of the documentation
  (markdown files) are not included in this scope
- **style**: CSS fixes, formatting, missing semicolons, :nail_care:
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature, and
  is too big to be considered `chore`
- **chore**: Maintenance changes related to code cleaning that isn't considered
  part of a refactor, build process updates, dependency bumps, or auxiliary
  tools and libraries updates (npm modules, Travis-ci, etc...)


##### Scope

The scope is the part of the codebase that is affected by your change. Choosing
it is at your discretion, but here are some of the most frequent ones:

- **`<ce or ee>/<section>`**: A change that affects Kong docs or Kong
  Enterprise docs and specifies which section.
- **`admin`**: Changes related to the Admin API documentation
- **`proxy`**: Changes related to the proxy documentation
- **`conf`**: Changes related to the configuration file documentation (new
  values, improvements...)
- **`<plugin-or-extension-name>`**: A change to any of the listings in the
  Kong Hub. This could be `basic-auth`, or `ldap` for example
- **`*`**: When the change affects too many parts of the codebase at once (this
  should be rare and avoided)


##### Examples

Here are a few examples of good commit messages to take inspiration from:

```
docs(ee/dev-portal) cleanup installation instructions

* add ports exposed for Dev Portal functionality
* use relative links and version them when necessary

From #623
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)


#### Linting

As mentioned in the guidelines, to submit a patch, the linter must succeed. You
can run the linter like so:

```bash
$ npm run test
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Contributing images, videos, etc

Binary files like images and videos should not be included in your pull
request, except custom icons for the Kong Hub - any request
including them will be rejected.

Instead, please:

1. Include the HTML necessary to display your binary file in your code
1. In place of the link to the binary file, use `FIXME`
1. Email your binary files to support@konghq.com, and include a link to your
   pull request
1. Kong staff will host your binary files on our CDN, and will replace the
   `FIXME`s in your code with URLs of the binaries

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Formatting Documentation

#### Markdown Front Matter

Markdown files on the doc site (excluding `docs.konghq.com/hub/`) must have a
yaml front matter section with at least one parameter (`title`). You can also
specify additional parameters to change how the doc source renders in the
output.

**Required:**

``` yaml
title: Page Title
```

**Optional:**

``` yaml
no_search: true
# Disables search for the page.

toc: false
# Disables the right-hand nav for the page; useful if the page is short and has
# one or no headers.

beta: true
alpha: true
# Labels the page as beta or alpha; adds a banner to the top of the page.

disable_image_expand: true
# Stops images from expanding in a modal on click. Sets it for the entire page.

class: no-copy-code
# Disables the copy code button in any code blocks on the page.
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Variables
Use variables for product names and release versions.

- `{{page.kong_version}}` - Outputs the version of the current page
- `{{site.ee_product_name}}` - Kong Enterprise
- `{{site.ce_product_name}}` - Kong Gateway

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Links
In markdown(`.md`) files, use relative links with a version variable.
- For Community: `/{{page.kong_version}}/file`
- For Enterprise: `/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/file`

If you're adding a new topic, you also need to add it to the nav file for its
version. These are located under `app/_data`. In these files, the path is
relative to the versioned folder.

For example, if the project path is `app/enterprise/2.1.x/overview`, the path in
the nav file would be `/overview`.

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Info Blocks

Info blocks are HTML divs that follow this basic format:
```
<div class="alert alert-type">
   Some text.
</div>
```

For a basic info block, use:
```
<div class="alert alert-ee blue">
Some text.
</div>
```

For a warning, use:
```
<div class="alert alert-warning">
   Some text.
</div>
```

For a breaking issue or notice of alpha/beta, use:
```
<div class="alert alert-ee red">
   Some text.
</div>
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Table of Contents generator

Almost all pages have an automatic Table of Contents (ToC) added to the right of
the page.

To inhibit the automatic addition of ToC (such as on API reference pages),
add the following to the front-matter: `toc: false`.

This ToC generator depends on headings being correctly coded in the markdown
portion of the doc site files, and will only pick up H2 and H3 level headings.
If a page has an incorrectly-formatted ToC, be sure to check the following:

- Heading levels must be correctly nested. Thus, heading levels like this:

```
### Sub-sub-heading Level 3
## Sub-heading Level 2
### Sub-sub-heading Level 3
```

will cause the first H3 to be skipped, and should be corrected to:

```
## Sub-heading Level 2
## Sub-heading Level 2
### Sub-sub-heading Level 3
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Codeblocks

Codeblocks are containers for your code examples. In Markdown, you can create
them using three backticks, aka fenced codeblocks:

<code>
```bash</br>
some code here</br>
```
</code>

Include a language whenever possible (in the example above, that language is
`bash`). This will format your codeblocks using language-specific syntax.

You can also create tabbed codeblocks, so that users can easily switch to
their preferred format. See [navtabs for codeblocks](#navtabs-for-codeblocks).

##### Line numbers
By default, every codeblock is generated with line numbers, which is useful for
calling out specific sections of code. If you need to disable the line numbers,
use the `{% highlight %}` tag with an optional language class instead of
 backticks. For example:

```
{% highlight bash %}
some code here
{% endhighlight %}
```

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

#### Using navtabs within topics

If your topic provides instructions for two or more methods of completing a
task, you can nest them inside `navtabs`. For example, this topic
[here](https://docs.konghq.com/getting-started-guide/latest/expose-services/#add-a-service)
tabs between the Admin API and Kong Manager methods for adding a Service.

Here's how you use them:

```
{% navtabs %}
{% navtab <your title here> %}

Here's some content.

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab <some other title> %}

Here's some more content.

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
```

On initial page load, the first tab (`"<your title here>"` in the example above)
will be the one displayed.

> **Note:** You can‚Äôt nest navtabs within navtabs.

##### Navtabs for codeblocks

A specialized use of navtabs is the `codeblock` style. This will create copyable
tabbed codeblocks for easy code comparison and better use of space. See
[here](https://docs.konghq.com/enterprise/2.1.x/deployment/installation/kong-for-kubernetes/)
for an example of this style in use.

> **Important!** Codeblock navtabs must contain codeblocks and **nothing else**.
Additionally, tabbed codeblocks can't be used in lists or steps.

To create a tabbed codeblock, specify the `codeblock` class in the first element
when creating a `navtabs` group:

    {% navtabs codeblock %}
    {% navtab cURL %}
     ```sh
     $ curl some request
     ```
    {% endnavtab %}
    {% navtab HTTPie %}
     ```sh
     $ httpie some request
     ```
    {% endnavtab %}
    {% endnavtabs %}
