      description: >
        The personal access token is meant to be used as an alternative to
        basic-auth when accessing Konnect via APIs.

        You can generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) from the [personal access
        token page](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/tokens/) in the Konnect
        dashboard.

        The PAT token must be passed in the header of a request, for example:

        `curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/users/' --header
        'Authorization: Bearer kpat_xgfT...'`

      bearerFormat: Token
      description: >
        The system account access token is meant for automations and
        integrations that are not directly associated with a human identity.

        You can generate a system account Access Token by creating a system
        account and then obtaining a system account access token for that
        account.

        The access token must be passed in the header of a request, for example:

        `curl -X GET 'https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/users/' --header
        'Authorization: Bearer spat_i2Ej...'`
