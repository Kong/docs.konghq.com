The purpose of this directory is: 

* To store API specs for the creation of the  "Run on Insomnia" buttons found on the [API docs page](https://docs.konghq.com/api/). The source of truth for these specs is the [platform-api](https://github.com/Kong/platform-api) repo.

* To host the source of truth for the beta Kong Gateway Enterprise and Open Source Admin API specs.


The latest consumable versions of the API spec are available at https://docs.konghq.com/api/


## How to update Gateway admin API documentation

While we are in beta stage if you have to add/delete an endpoint, edit parameters, add parameter descriptions, add examples, and so on, **edit the spec directly** in its source location.


## Update non-admin API specs

The source of truth for all other specs is the [platform-api](https://github.com/Kong/platform-api) repo. Open a PR against a spec to update it.
