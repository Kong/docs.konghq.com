      OpenAPI 3.0 spec for Kong Gateway's Enterprise Admin API.
      <br><br>

      Kong Gateway comes with an **internal** RESTful Admin API for administration purposes.
      Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will
      keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.
      - `8001` is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
      - `8444` is the default port for HTTPS traffic to the Admin API.

      This API is designed for internal use and provides full control over Kong, so
      care should be taken when setting up Kong environments to avoid undue public
      exposure of this API.
