title: Running Kong as a Non-Root User
---

After installing {{site.ce_product_name}} on a GNU/Linux system, you can
configure Kong to run as the built-in `kong` user and group instead of `root`.
This makes the Nginx master and worker processes run as the `kong` user and
group, overriding any settings in the
[`nginx_user`](/{{page.kong_version}}/configuration/#nginx_user)
configuration property.

  <b>Warning</b>
  <br>The Nginx master process needs to run as <code>root</code> for
  Nginx to execute certain actions (for example, to listen on the privileged
  port 80).
  <br>
  <br>Although running Kong as the <code>kong</code> user
  and group does provide more security, we advise that a system and network
  administration evaluation be performed before making this decision. Otherwise,
  Kong nodes might become unavailable due to insufficient permissions to execute
  privileged system calls in the operating system.
