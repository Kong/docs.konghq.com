  ArecaBay enables enterprises to Discover, Monitor, and Secure APIs at object/data level.

  ArecaBay's Kong plugin installed in the Kong cluster is one type of ArecaBay MicroSensors that are light-weight software components built to access real-time API call level data without any modification to the applications or their runtime. They enable ArecaBay’s <b>Dynamic API Risk Trackers (DART)</b> and <b>API DLP</b>: a set of API level trackers and Data Leakage Prevention.

  DART provides an API data security posture dashboard for DevSecOps to continuously discover and monitor APIs across all clouds with zero-impact to apps. DART’s anomaly detection enables API DLP to take policy action against highly targeted data fields and transactions. Please visit this [link](https://www.arecabay.com/dart/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} for more details.

  In addition to API Security, for developers and/or DevOps, ArecaBay's Kong plugin can be used to monitor and log application API calls with selective object level data.

## Installation
The installation of ArecaBay's Kong Plugin and the corresponding ArecaBay components is extremely simple and easy. It involves the following two steps:
1. Install and setup ArecaBay's Kong Plugin
2. Access ArecaBay Cloud Webconsole and configure ArecaBay Kong Plugin as a MicroSensor

### Install and setup ArecaBay's Kong Plugin
Install the ArecaBay's Kong plugin (ab-microsensor) on each node in your Kong cluster via luarocks. As this plugin source is already hosted in Luarocks.org, please run the below command:

```
luarocks install kong-plugin-ab-microsensor
```

Add to the custom_plugins list in your Kong configuration (on each Kong node):

```
custom_plugins = ab-microsensor
```

### Access ArecaBay Cloud Webconsole and setup LocalBay
Please visit the [Partners page](https://www.arecabay.com/partners/kong) and request your ArecaBay Cloud Webconsole account. Follow the quickstart guide within the Webconsole to configure your Kong Plugin as a MicroSensor. This involves providing details for the Kong Plugin MicroSensor and downloading the setup script. Run the setup script which internally uses the Kong Admin API to configure & run the Kong Plugin as a global plugin.
