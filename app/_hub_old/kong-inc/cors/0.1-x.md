## Known issues

Below is a list of known issues or limitations for this plugin.

### CORS Limitations

If the client is a browser, there is a known issue with this plugin caused by a
limitation of the CORS specification that doesn't allow to specify a custom
`Host` header in a preflight `OPTIONS` request.

Because of this limitation, this plugin will only work for APIs that have been
configured with a `uris` setting, and it will not work for APIs that
are being resolved using a custom DNS (the `hosts` property).

To learn how to configure `uris` for an API, please read the [Proxy
Reference][proxy-reference].
