title: Deployment Options

{{site.ee_product_name}} can be deployed in the following main modes:
* [**Embedded:**](#embedded) classic deployment with all services on one node.
* [**Distributed:**](#distributed) classic deployment with distributed services.
* [**Hybrid:**](#hybrid-mode) Control Plane and Data Planes are separate.

## Classic deployment

### Embedded

In this deployment mode, you install one instance of Kong, and all of its add-ons
reside on the same node. This option is normally used for testing and development.

  <b>Warning:</b> The embedded mode is intended for evaluation and development
  environments and <b>should not</b> be used for a production environment.

To learn more, see the [installation documentation](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/deployment/installation/overview/).

### Distributed

In a production environment, we recommend that you install multiple instances of
Kong on separate nodes. Each of these nodes must connect to the Kong database,
which can be Postgres or Cassandra.

To set up a distributed deployment, install the Control Plane Kong instance
following the [embedded installation instructions](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/deployment/installation/overview/)
for your platform, then bring up subsequent instances for the Data Planes without
enabling any add-ons (e.g., Kong Manager, Developer Portal).

For further distributed setup help, contact Kong Support.

## Hybrid mode

In a Hybrid mode deployment, {{site.ee_product_name}} instances are divided into
two roles: Control Plane (CP) and Data Plane (DP). Only the Control Plane
requires a database, and it propagates Kong configuration to Data Plane nodes,
which use in-memory storage. The Data Plane nodes can be installed anywhere,
on-premise or in the cloud.
