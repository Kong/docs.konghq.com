## Improve Vitals performance with InfluxDB

Leveraging a time series database for Vitals data
can improve request and Vitals performance in very-high traffic {{site.ee_product_name}}
clusters (such as environments handling tens or hundreds of thousands of
requests per second), without placing additional write load on the database
backing the Kong cluster.

For information about using Kong Vitals with a database as the backend (for example,
PostgreSQL, Cassandra), refer to
[Kong Vitals](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api/vitals/).

## Setting up Kong Vitals with InfluxDB

### Step 1. Install Kong Gateway

If you already have a {{site.base_gateway}} instance, skip to [Step 2](#step-2-deploy-a-kong-gateway-enterprise-license).

If you have not installed {{site.base_gateway}}, a Docker installation
will work for the purposes of this guide.

{% include /md/2.5.x/docker-install-steps.md heading="#### " heading1="#### " heading2="#### " heading3="#### " kong_version=page.kong_version %}

#### Start the gateway with Kong Manager

```bash
$ docker run -d --name kong-ee --network=kong-ee-net \
  -e "KONG_DATABASE=postgres" \
  -e "KONG_PG_HOST=kong-ee-database" \
  -e "KONG_PG_PASSWORD=kong" \
  -e "KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" \
  -e "KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" \
  -e "KONG_PROXY_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" \
  -e "KONG_ADMIN_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" \
  -e "KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8001" \
  -e "KONG_ADMIN_GUI_URL=http://<DNSorIP>:8002" \
  -e "KONG_VITALS_STRATEGY=influxdb" \
  -e "KONG_VITALS_TSDB_ADDRESS=influxdb:8086" \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -p 8443:8443 \
  -p 8001:8001 \
  -p 8444:8444 \
  -p 8002:8002 \
  -p 8445:8445 \
  -p 8003:8003 \
  -p 8004:8004 \
  kong-ee
```

{:.note}
> **Note:** For `KONG_ADMIN_GUI_URL`, replace `DNSorIP`
with with the DNS name or IP of the Docker host. <code>KONG_ADMIN_GUI_URL</code>
_should_ have a protocol, for example, `http://`.

### Step 2. Deploy a Kong Gateway (Enterprise) license

If you already have a {{site.ee_product_name}} license attached to your {{site.base_gateway}}
instance, skip to [Step 3](#step-3-start-an-influxdb-database).

You will not be able to access the Kong Vitals functionality without a valid
{{site.ee_product_name}} license attached to your {{site.base_gateway}} instance.

{% include /md/enterprise/deploy-license.md heading="####" kong_version=page.kong_version %}

### Step 3. Start an InfluxDB database

Production-ready InfluxDB installations should be deployed as a separate
effort, but for proof-of-concept testing, running a local InfluxDB instance
is possible with Docker:

```bash
$ docker run -p 8086:8086 \
  --network=<YOUR_NETWORK_NAME> \
  --name influxdb \
  -e INFLUXDB_DB=kong \
  influxdb:1.8.4-alpine
```

{:.warning}
> You **must** use InfluxDB 1.8.4-alpine because
InfluxDB 2.0 will **not** work.  

Writing Vitals data to InfluxDB requires that the `kong` database is created,
this is done using the `INFLUXDB_DB` variable.

### Step 4. Configure Kong Gateway

{:.note}
> **Note:** If you used the configuration in
[Step 1. Installing {{site.base_gateway}} on Docker](#step-1-install-kong-gateway),
then you do not need to complete this step.

In addition to enabling Kong Vitals, {{site.base_gateway}} must be configured to use InfluxDB as the
backing strategy for Vitals. The InfluxDB host and port must also be defined:

```bash
$ echo "KONG_VITALS_STRATEGY=influxdb KONG_VITALS_TSDB_ADDRESS=influxdb:8086 kong reload exit" \
| docker exec -i kong-ee /bin/sh
```

## Understanding Vitals data using InfluxDB measurements

Kong Vitals records metrics in two InfluxDB measurements:

1. `kong_request`: Contains field values for request latencies and HTTP,
  and tags for various Kong entities associated with the requests (for
  example, the Route and Service in question).
2. `kong_datastore_cache`: Contains points about cache hits and
  misses.

To display the measurement schemas on your InfluxDB instance running
in Docker:

1. Open command line in your InfluxDB Docker container.

    ```sh
    $ docker exec -it influxdb /bin/sh
    ```

2. Log in to the InfluxDB CLI.

    ```sh
    $ influx -precision rfc3339
    ```

3. Enter the InfluxQL query for returning a list of tag keys associated
with the specified database.

    ```sql
    > SHOW TAG KEYS ON kong
    ```

    Example result:

    ```sql
    name: kong_request
    tagKey
    ------
    consumer
    hostname
    route
    service
    status_f
    wid
    workspace

    name: kong_datastore_cache
    tagKey
    ------
    hostname
    wid
    ```

4. Enter the InfluxQL query for returning the field keys and the
data type of their field values.

    ```sh
    > SHOW FIELD KEYS ON kong
    ```

    Example result:

    ```sql
    name: kong_request
    fieldKey	         fieldType
    --------	         ---------
    kong_latency       integer
    proxy_latency      integer
    request_latency    integer
    status             integer

    name: kong_datastore_cache
    fieldKey  fieldType
    --------  ---------

    hits      integer
    misses    integer
    ```

The tag `wid` is used to differentiate the unique worker ID per host, to avoid
duplicate metrics shipped at the same point in time.

As demonstrated above, the series cardinality of the `kong_request` measurement
varies based on the cardinality of the Kong cluster configuration - a greater
number of Service/Route/Consumer/Workspace combinations handled by Kong results
in a greater series cardinality as written by Vitals.

## Sizing an InfluxDB node/cluster for Vitals

Consult the
[InfluxDB sizing guidelines](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/guides/hardware_sizing/)
for reference on appropriately sizing an InfluxDB node/cluster.

{:.note}
> **Note:** The query behavior when reading Vitals data falls under the "moderate" load
category as defined by the InfluxDB sizing guidelines. Several `GROUP BY` statements and
functions are used to generate the Vitals API responses, which can require
significant CPU resources to execute when hundreds of thousands or millions of
data points are present.

## Query frequency and precision

Kong buffers Vitals metrics and writes InfluxDB points in batches to improve
throughput in InfluxDB and reduce overhead in the Kong proxy path. Each Kong
worker process flushes its buffer of metrics every 5 seconds or 5000 data points,
whichever comes first.

Metrics points are written with microsecond (`u`) precision. To comply with
the [Vitals API](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api/vitals/#vitals-api), measurement
values are read back grouped by second.

{:.note}
> **Note:** Because of limitations in the OpenResty API, writing values with
microsecond precision requires an additional syscall per request.

## Managing the retention policy of the kong database

Vitals InfluxDB data points are not downsampled or managed by a
retention policy through Kong. InfluxDB operators are encouraged to manually manage
the retention policy of the `kong` database to reduce the disk space and memory
needed to manage Vitals data points.
