## 2.3.0.0 (beta)
**Release Date** 2020/01/20

### **Kong Enterprise**
The following sections list {{site.ee_product_name}}-exclusive updates,
features, and fixes for the **2.3.0.0 beta** version.

### Features

#### Enterprise
- Kong Enterprise can now run without a license in **Free Mode**. 
  - In Free Mode, functionality includes **Kong Gateway (OSS)** and **Kong Manager**. 
  - To enhance your Free Mode instance, you can add Enterprise functionality modules 
  and features including **Kong Vitals**, **RBAC**, **Workspaces**, and **Kong Enterprise Plugins**. 
  Contact your Kong sales representative for more information. 

#### Core
- Kong checks version compatibility between the control plane and any data planes to ensure 
the data planes and any plugins have compatibility with the control plane in hybrid mode. 
The sync is stopped if the major/minor version differ or if the installed plugin versions 
differ between control plane and data plane nodes.
- Kong now accepts UTF-8 characters in route and service names. Entities with a `name` field 
now support UTF-8 characters.
- Certificates now have `cert_alt` and `key_alt` fields to specify an alternative certificate 
and key pair.
- The Go pluginserver `stderr` and `stdout` are now written into Kong’s logs, allowing Golang’s 
native `log.Printf()`. 
  - Introduced support for multiple pluginservers. This feature is backwards-compatible with 
  the existing single Go pluginserver.

#### Plugin Development Kit (PDK)
- Introduced a `kong.node.get_hostname` method that returns current node's host name.
- Introduced a `kong.cluster.get_id` method that returns a unique ID
  for the current Kong cluster. If Kong is running in DB-less mode
  without a cluster ID explicitly defined, this method returns nil.
  For Hybrid mode, all Control Planes and Data Planes belonging to the
  same cluster returns the same cluster ID. For traditional database
  type deployments, all Kong nodes pointing to the same database will
  also return the same cluster ID.
- Introduced a `kong.log.set_serialize_value`, which allows customizing
  the output of `kong.log.serialize`.

#### Plugins
- The [HTTP Log](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/http-log/) (`http-log`) plugin 
has been improved to allow you to add headers to the HTTP request, which will help you integrate 
with many observability systems.
- The [Key Authentication](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/key-auth/) (`key-auth`)
plugin has two new configuration parameters: `key_in_header` and `key_in_query`. Both 
are booleans and tell Kong whether to accept (true) or reject (false) passed in either 
the header or the query string. Both default to “true.”
- The [Request Size Limiting](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/request-size-limiting/) 
(`request-size-limiting`) plugin has a new configuration `require_content_length` that 
causes the plugin to ensure a valid Content-Length header exists before reading the request body.
- The [Serverless Functions](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/serverless-functions/) 
(`serverless-functions`) plugin introduces a sandboxing capability, is *enabled* by default, 
and where only Kong PDK, OpenResty `ngx` APIs, and Lua standard libraries are allowed.

#### Configuration
- `client_max_body_size` and `client_body_buffer_size`, that previously
  hardcoded to 10m, are now configurable through `nginx_admin_client_max_body_size` 
  and `nginx_admin_client_body_buffer_size`.
- Kong-generated SSL private keys now have `600` file system permission.
- Properties `ssl_cert`, `ssl_cert_key`, `admin_ssl_cert`,
  `admin_ssl_cert_key`, `status_ssl_cert`, and `status_ssl_cert_key`
  is now an array: previously, only an RSA certificate was generated
  by default; with this change, an ECDSA is also generated. On
  intermediate and modern cipher suites, the ECDSA certificate is set
  as the default fallback certificate; on old cipher suite, the RSA
  certificate remains as the default. On custom certificates, the first
  certificate specified in the array is used.
- Kong now runs as a `kong` user if it exists; if user does not exist
  in the system, the `nobody` user is used, as before.
  
### Dependencies
- Bumped `kong-plugin-serverless-functions` from 1.0 to 2.1.
- Bumped `lua-resty-dns-client` from 5.1.0 to 5.2.0.
- Bumped `lua-resty-healthcheck` from 1.3.0 to 1.4.0.
- Bumped `OpenSSL` from 1.1.1h to 1.1.1i.
- Bumped `kong-plugin-zipkin` from 1.1 to 1.2.
- Bumped `kong-plugin-request-transformer` from 1.2 to 1.3.

### Fixes

#### Core
- Fixed issue where a Go plugin would fail to read `kong.ctx.shared` values set by LUA plugins.
- Properly trigger `dao:delete_by:post` hook.
- Fixed issue where a route that supports both http and https (and has a hosts and snis 
match criteria) would fail to proxy http requests, as it does not contain an SNI.
- Fixed issue where a `nil` request context would lead to errors `attempt to index local 'ctx'`
being shown in the logs.
- Reduced the number of needed timers to active health check upstreams and to resolve hosts.
- Schemas for full-schema validations are correctly cached now, avoiding memory
  leaks when reloading declarative configurations. 
- The schema for the upstream entities now limits the highest configurable
  number of successes and failures to 255, respecting the limits imposed by
  `lua-resty-healthcheck`. 
- Certificates for database connections now are loaded in the right order
  avoiding failures to connect to Postgres databases.

#### CLI
- Fixed issue where `kong reload -c <config>` would fail.
- Fixed issue where the Kong configuration cache would get corrupted.

#### Developer Portal
- Fixed issue when applying permissions to developers using the Application Registration feature.

#### Plugin Development Kit (PDK)
- Ensure the log serializer encodes the `tries` field as an array when
  empty, rather than an object.

#### Plugins
- The [Request Transformer](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/request-transformer/) (`request-transformer`) 
plugin does not allow `null` in config anymore as they can lead to runtime errors.
- [OpenID Connect](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/) (`openid-connect`) issue 
fixed causing a 500 auth error when falling back to an anonymous user.  

### Deprecated 
#### Distributions
- Support for CentOS-6 is removed and entered end-of-life on Nov 30, 2020.


## 2.2.1.0
**Release Date** 2020/12/31
 
### Features

#### Developer Portal
- Added `key-auth` support to Portal Application Registration.

### Fixes

#### Core
- OpenSSL version bumped to 1.1.1i.
  The OpenSSL version bump is related to CVE-2020-1971. We have performed an extensive review of OpenSSL usage in Kong and have found the following:
  - The core product is not vulnerable to the high severity CVE-2020-1971. 
  - The `mtls-auth` plugin had a potential exploit associated with with CVE-2020-1971, but it would require an attacker to control a trusted CA or have admin port access, which [we recommend you block from attackers](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/secure-admin-api/) for numerous reasons. The updated OpenSSL version in this release additionally protects the `mtls-auth` plugin.
  - As a precautionary measure, we have bumped the OpenSSL dependency version to OpenSSL 1.1.1i.

#### Enterprise
- Fixed an issue where `/tmp` directories will not be deleted when running Kong or Kong CLI.
- Fixed an issue that prevented the use of keyring encryption of Kong database fields.
- RCE (Remote Code Execution) Plugin Mitigations: 
  Several Kong plugins allow arbitrary code execution by design, including the `serverless` plugin (also known as `pre-function` and `post-function` capabilities) and the `exit-transformer` plugin (for example, allows an administrator to configure a Lua-based response transformation). Changes include:
  - A new change locks down these plugins so that they have limited functions available in a sandbox, providing significant additional security for a user with an exposed admin port.
  - Functions such as "require" are no longer available to scripts that run in these plugins for security purposes, because allowing "require" allows embedded additional arbitrary code execution. 
  - **Important**: This change causes a **breaking change** in this patch release and it cannot be avoided. Our recommendation is that [users lock down their admin ports](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/secure-admin-api/) to avoid attackers trying to exploit any API gateway, like Kong, to gain access to internal networks. If you need the previous release behavior, including the ability to arbitrarily "require" libraries or if you want to lock things down further, we have introduced four new settings you can use:
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA = on|off` Sets whether any custom Lua code can be used outside of Kong's distributed code. Defaults to "on".
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX = on|off` Turns on or off the sandbox. Defaults to "on".
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX_REQUIRES = foo,bar` Which libraries, if any, you want to require in the sandbox. Defaults to an empty list.
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX_ENVIRONMENT = kong.request` Any additional objects you want to pass through to the sandbox environments.  Defaults to an empty list.

#### Developer Portal
- In the Developer Portal Edit Application dialog, the Edit button is renamed to Save.

#### Plugins
- Collector (`collector`, used for Immunity)
  - Use `kong.request.get_body()`
- [Mutual TLS Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/mtls-auth) (`mtls-auth`)
  - Fixed (log) updating auth errors to handle fallthrough scenarios.
  - Fixed (route, ws) ensuring workspace options are used for cache lookups.
- [Forward Proxy Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/forward-proxy)(`forward-proxy`)
  - Fixed an issue where PDK logging phase check causes an error.
- [OpenID Connect](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect) (`openid-connect`)
  - Bumped `lua-resty-session` dependency to 3.8 to allow passing connection options to redis cluster client.
- [Session](/hub/kong-inc/session) (`session`)
  - Added endpoint key to Admin API.
  - Bumped `lua-resty-session` dependency to 3.8.
  
#### Breaking Changes
- See *RCE (Remote Code Execution) Plugin Mitigations* in the Kong Enterprise section.

## 2.2.0.0 (beta)
**Release Date** 2020/10/27

### **Kong Enterprise**
The following sections list {{site.ee_product_name}}-exclusive updates,
features, and fixes for the **2.2.0.0 beta** version.

### Dependencies
- Bumped the required lua-resty-openssl version to
[0.6.8](https://github.com/fffonion/lua-resty-openssl/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#068---2020-10-15).

### Features {#beta-features-2200}

#### Core
- Added support for TLS Redis connections when using the Kong Redis library.
- Added support for running Kong as the non-root user `kong` on distributed
systems.

#### Plugins
- OpenID Connect (`openid-connect`)
  - Added the `issuers_allowed` configuration parameter, which introduces the
  ability to specify valid issuers for access token ISS claim.
  - Added the ability to pass `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer`
  assertions with the `client_credentials` authentication method.
  - Added the `userinfo_endpoint` configuration parameter, which allows
  manual definition of a user info endpoint.
  - Added the ability to find nested claims using array indices. Array indices
  start at 1, same as in Lua.
  - Added issuer cache warmup on node start.
- **Encryption support:** The Redis strategy now supports TLS connections.
  Introduced the `redis.ssl`, `redis.ssl_verify`, and `redis.server_name`
  parameters for confguring TLS connections. Applies to the following plugins:
  - Rate Limiting Advanced (`rate-limiting-advanced`)
  - Proxy Caching Advanced (`proxy-cache-advanced`)

### Fixes {#beta-fixes-2200}

#### Core
- **Hybrid mode**:
  - Fixed an issue where, in a cluster with multiple Control
  Planes, configuration changes made by one Control Plane would not be picked up
  by other Control Planes, and therefore would not be pushed to all Data Planes.
  - Fixed an issue with custom certificates. When using a workspace other than
  `default`, Kong Gateway did not present the configured certificate when the
  correct SNI was sent.

#### Plugins
- OpenID Connect (`openid-connect`)
  - Fixed a bug in issuer normalization.
  - Improved discovery and rediscovery to be more resilient.
  - When refreshing tokens, the old `id_token` is now preserved if a new one is
  not given.
  - Fixed an issue where token decoding also re-verified claims. Changed it
  to skip claim verification when decoding tokens.
  - Fixed issue of sharing the cache key using the same credentials but with
    different endpoint arguments. Added a new parameter: `cache_tokens_salt`.
    The value for this parameter is auto-generated by default, which means that
    the token endpoint cache is not automatically shared between different
    plugin instances.
  - Fixed issue that caused the `unexpected_redirect_uri` setting to be
  ignored.
  - Fixed redirects to use `kong.response.exit`, which implements the proper
  short-circuiting semantics in Kong.
- OAuth Introspection (`oauth2-introspection`)
  - Fixed an issue where the cache would not be properly invalidated
  when a Consumer username was updated.
- Proxy Caching Advanced (`proxy-cache-advanced`)
  - Fixed a 500 error that would appear when the URL contained empty query
  string parameters.
- Exit Transformer (`exit-transformer`)
  - Fixed some cases where an `unknown` exit would not be handled.
- AWS Lambda (`aws-lambda`)
  - Respect the `skip_large_bodies` config setting even when not using AWS API
    Gateway compatibility.
- ACME (`acme`)
  - Changed the cache to use non-nil TTL in Hybrid mode. This fixes a bug for
    renewals not updating the certificate after Kong Gateway 2.0.5.
  - Fixed a bug in database mode where the renewal configuration was not
    properly stored.
- Prometheus (`prometheus`)
  - Switched to using the `Kong.pdk.serializer` instead of the deprecated basic
    serializer.
- Collector (`collector`, used for Immunity)
  - Removed the `/service_maps` passthrough.


### **Kong Gateway (OSS)**

**Kong Enterprise 2.2.0.0 beta** inherits the following changes from the
open-source **Kong Gateway 2.2.0.0**:

### Dependencies

- For Kong Gateway 2.2, the required OpenResty version has been bumped to
  [1.17.8.2](http://openresty.org/en/changelog-1017008.html), and the
  the set of patches included has changed, including the latest release of
  [lua-kong-nginx-module](https://github.com/Kong/lua-kong-nginx-module).
  If you are installing Kong from one of our distribution
  packages, you are not affected by this change.
- Bumped OpenSSL version from `1.1.1g` to `1.1.1h`.
  [#6382](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6382)

    <div class="alert alert-ee blue">
    <strong>Note:</strong> If you are not using one of our distribution packages and compiling
    OpenResty from source, you must still apply Kong's <a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong-build-tools/tree/master/openresty-build-tools/openresty-patches">
    OpenResty patches</a>
    (and, as highlighted above, compile OpenResty with the new
    <code>lua-kong-nginx-module</code>). Our <a href="https://github.com/Kong/kong-build-tools">kong-build-tools</a>
    repository allows you to do both easily.
    </div>

- Cassandra 2.x support is now deprecated. If you are still
  using Cassandra 2.x with Kong, we recommend you to upgrade, since this
  series of Cassandra is about to be EOL with the upcoming release of
  Cassandra 4.0.

### Additions

#### Core

-  **UDP support**: Kong now features support for UDP proxying
  in its stream subsystem. The `"udp"` protocol is now accepted in the `protocols`
  attribute of Routes and the `protocol` attribute of Services.
  Load balancing and logging plugins support UDP as well.
  [#6215](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6215)
- **Configurable Request and Response Buffering**: The buffering of requests
  or responses can now be enabled or disabled on a per-route basis, through
  setting attributes `Route.request_buffering` or `Route.response_buffering`
  to `true` or `false`. The default behavior remains the same: buffering is
  enabled by default for requests and responses.
  [#6057](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6057)
- **Option to Automatically Load OS Certificates**: The configuration
  attribute `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` was extended to accept a
  comma-separated list of certificate paths, as well as a special `system`
  value, which expands to the system default certificates file installed
  by the operating system. This follows a very simple heuristic to try to
  use the most common certificate file in the most popular distros.
  [#6342](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6342)
- **The consistent-hashing load balancing algorithm** does not need to use the
  entire target history to build the same proxying destinations table on all
  Kong nodes anymore. Now, deleted targets are removed from the database and the
  target entities can be manipulated by the Admin API the same way as any other
  entity.
  [#6336](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6336)
- **Added `X-Forwarded-Path` header:** If a trusted source provides an
  `X-Forwarded-Path` header, it is proxied as is. Otherwise, Kong sets
  the content of said header to the request's path.
  [#6251](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6251)
- **Hybrid Mode:**
  - The table of Data Plane nodes at the Control Plane is now
    cleaned up automatically, according to a delay value configurable using
    the `cluster_data_plane_purge_delay` attribute, set to 14 days by default.
    [#6376](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6376)
  - Data Plane nodes now apply only the last config when receiving
    several updates in sequence, improving the performance when large configs
    are in use. [#6299](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6299)
  - Synchronization performance improvements: Kong now uses a
    new internal synchronization method to push changes from the Control Plane
    to the Data Plane, drastically reducing the amount of communication between
    nodes during bulk updates.
    [#6293](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6293)
- **The `Upstream.client_certificate` attribute** can now be used for proxying.
  This allows the `client_certificate` setting used for mTLS handshaking with
  the `Upstream` server to be shared easily among different Services.
  However, `Service.client_certificate` will take precedence over
  `Upstream.client_certificate` if both are set simultaneously.
  In previous releases, `Upstream.client_certificate` was only used for
  mTLS in active health checks.
  [#6348](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6348)
- **New `shorthand_fields` top-level attribute** in schema definitions, which
  deprecates `shorthands` and includes type definitions in addition to the
  shorthand callback.
  [#6364](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6364)

#### Admin API

- **Hybrid Mode:** Introduced the new endpoint `/clustering/data-planes`, which
  returns complete information about all Data Plane nodes that are connected to
  the Control Plane cluster, regardless of the Control Plane node to which they
  are connected.
  [#6308](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6308)
- Admin API responses now honor the `headers` configuration setting for
  including or removing the `Server` header.
  [#6371](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6371)

#### PDK

- New function `kong.request.get_forwarded_prefix`: Returns the prefix path
  component of the request's URL that Kong stripped before proxying to upstream,
  respecting the value of `X-Forwarded-Prefix` when it comes from a trusted
  source.
  [#6251](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6251)
- The `kong.response.exit` now honors the `headers` configuration setting for
  including or removing the `Server` header.
  [#6371](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6371)
- The `kong.log.serialize` function now can be called using the stream subsystem,
  allowing various logging plugins to work under TCP and TLS proxy modes.
  [#6036](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6036)
- Requests with `multipart/form-data` MIME type now can use the same part name
  multiple times. [#6054](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6054)

#### Plugins

- **New Response Phase for custom plugins**: Both Go and Lua custom plugins now
  support a new plugin phase called `response` in Lua plugins and `Response` in
  Go. Using it automatically enables response buffering, which allows you to
  manipulate both the response headers and the response body in the same phase.
  This enables support for response handling in Go, where header and body
  filter phases are not available, allowing you to use PDK functions such
  as `kong.Response.GetBody()`, and provides an equivalent simplified
  feature for handling buffered responses from Lua plugins as well.
  [#5991](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/5991)
- [AWS Lambda](/hub/kong-inc/aws-lambda) (`aws-lambda`)
  - Bumped to version 3.5.0.
  [#6379](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6379)
  - Added support for the `isBase64Encoded` flag in Lambda function responses.
- [gRPC Web](/hub/kong-inc/grpc-web) (`grpc-web`)
  - Introduced the configuration parameter `pass_stripped_path`, which, if set
  to true, causes the plugin to pass the stripped request path (see the
  [`strip_path`](/enterprise/latest/admin-api/#route-object) Route attribute)
  to the upstream gRPC service.
- [Rate Limiting](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting) (`rate-limiting`)
  - Added support for rate limiting by path using the `limit_by = "path"`
  configuration attribute. Thanks [KongGuide](https://github.com/KongGuide) for
  the patch!
  [#6286](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6286)
- [Correlation ID](/hub/kong-inc/correlation-id) (`correlation-id`)
  - The plugin now generates a `correlation-id` value by default
  if the correlation ID header arrives but is empty.
  [#6358](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/6358)

### Deprecated Features

- **Hybrid mode:**  The `/clustering/status` endpoint is now deprecated, since it
  returned only information about Data Plane nodes directly connected to the
  Control Plane node to which the Admin API request was made. It is
  superseded by the new `/clustering/data-planes` endpoint.
- The `shorthands` attribute in schema definitions is deprecated in favor of
  the new `shorthand_fields` top-level attribute.
  

## 2.1.4.3
**Release Date** 2020/12/31
 
### Fixes

#### Core
- OpenSSL version bumped to 1.1.1i.
  The OpenSSL version bump is related to CVE-2020-1971. We have performed an extensive review of OpenSSL usage in Kong and have found the following:
  - The core product is not vulnerable to the high severity CVE-2020-1971. 
  - The `mtls-auth` plugin had a potential exploit associated with with CVE-2020-1971, but it would require an attacker to control a trusted CA or have admin port access, which [we recommend you block from attackers](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/secure-admin-api/) for numerous reasons. The updated OpenSSL version in this release additionally protects the `mtls-auth` plugin.
  - As a precautionary measure, we have bumped the OpenSSL dependency version to OpenSSL 1.1.1i.

#### Kong Enterprise
- RCE (Remote Code Execution) Plugin Mitigations: 
  Several Kong plugins allow arbitrary code execution by design, including the `serverless` plugin (also known as `pre-function` and `post-function` capabilities) and the `exit-transformer` plugin (for example, allows an administrator to configure a Lua-based response transformation). Changes include:
  - A new change in this release locks down these plugins so that they have limited functions available in a sandbox, providing significant additional security for a user with an exposed admin port.

    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA = on|off` Sets whether any custom Lua code can be used outside of Kong's distributed code. Defaults to "on".
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX = on|off` Turns on or off the sandbox. Defaults to "on".
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX_REQUIRES = foo,bar` Which libraries, if any, you want to require in the sandbox. Defaults to an empty list.
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX_ENVIRONMENT = kong.request` Any additional objects you want to pass through to the sandbox environments.  Defaults to an empty list.

- Backport Admins Migration Fix: When upgrading from 1.5.x.y to versions prior to 2.2.0.0, there was a known migration issue that prevented the upgrade from continuing and also generated log errors. This issue was caused by a bug in the handling of which workspaces consumers were assigned to. Release 2.1.4.3 resolves this issue the same way it does for 2.2.0.0. It is recommended that if you are upgrading to 2.1.x.y, that you use 2.1.4.3 to avoid migration errors.

#### Kong Manager

### Features

**Note: Feature updates for Kong Enterprise 2.1.3.0 version includes [2.1.0.0 (beta)](/enterprise/changelog/#features) features.**

#### Kong Gateway
* Inherited changes from OSS Kong in releases 2.0.x, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.1.3.
* Workspaces code has been refactored for performance. The feature should work the same for most users.
* TLS version may be specified when using TLS to connect to a Postgres database.

#### Kong Manager
* Open ID Connect (`openid-connect`) can now be used with [Mapping Service Directory Groups to Kong Roles](/enterprise/latest/kong-manager/service-directory-mapping/) using `config.authenticated_groups_claim`.
* Can now see the `created_at` timestamp for consumer credentials.
* Provide a warning when a user's session is about to expire.
* Generate an RBAC token for an administrator rather than letting them set one.
* Plugin forms now have docs links to the [Plugins Hub](/hub/).

#### Kong Developer Portal
* Application Registration can now be configured to use a third-party OAuth provider.

#### Plugins
* [Open ID Connect](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/) (`openid-connect`)
  * Added `X-Authenticated-Groups` request header when doing authenticated groups.
  * Added `config.groups_required` and `config.groups_claim`.
  * Added `config.roles_required` and `config.roles_claim`.

  * Added `DELETE :8001/openid-connect/jwks` endpoint (for rotating the jwks).
  * Added Admin API for DBless (it is a single node only).
  * Added support for `x5t` key lookups.
  * Added support for same `x5t` but different `alg` lookups.
  * Changed that `config.authenticated_groups_claim` is considered even on successful consumer mapping so that it enables dynamic groups, while using consumer mapping. This feature is used with [Mapping Service Directory Groups to Kong Roles](/enterprise/latest/kong-manager/service-directory-mapping/).
  * Changed code to be more resilient on rediscovery errors.
  * Changed `config.rediscovery_lifetime` to default to 30 seconds instead of 300 seconds (5 minutes).

### Known Issues and Workarounds

**Note: Known issues and workarounds for Kong Enterprise includes [2.1.0.0 (beta)](/enterprise/changelog/#known-issues-and-workarounds) known issues and workarounds.**

* The LDAP Authentication and LDAP Authentication Advanced plugins require a workaround to support CLI access with RBAC tokens: [Using Service Directory Mapping on the CLI](/enterprise/2.1.x/kong-manager/authentication/ldap/#using-service-directory-mapping-on-the-cli).

* The [Rate Limiting Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced) plugin does not support the `cluster` strategy in hybrid mode. The `redis` strategy must be used instead.

* For the [Request Transformer Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/request-transformer-advanced/) plugin, standardize on `allow` instead of `whitelist` to specify the parameter names that should be allowed in request JSON body. Previous `whitelist` nomenclature is deprecated and support will be removed in Kong 3.0.

* Breaking changes

  * When performing upgrade and migration to 2.1.x, custom entities and plugins have breaking changes. See [https://docs.konghq.com/enterprise/2.1.x/deployment/upgrades/custom-changes/](https://docs.konghq.com/enterprise/2.1.x/deployment/upgrades/custom-changes/).

  * `run_on` is removed from plugins, as it has not been used for a long time but compatibility was kept in 1.x. Any plugin with `run_on` will now break because the schema no longer contains that entry. If testing custom plugins against this beta release, update the plugin's schema.lua file and remove the `run_on` field.

  * The [Correlation ID](/hub/kong-inc/correlation-id/) (`correlation-id`) plugin has a higher priority than in CE. This is an incompatible change with CE in case `correlation-id` is configured against a Consumer.

  * The ability to share an entity between Workspaces is no longer supported. The new method requires a copy of the entity to be created in the other Workspaces.

## 1.5.0.9
**Release Date** 2020/12/31

### Fixes

#### Core
-  OpenSSL version bumped to 1.1.1i.
  The OpenSSL version bump is related to CVE-2020-1971. We have performed an extensive review of OpenSSL usage in Kong and have found the following:
  - The core product is not vulnerable to the high severity CVE-2020-1971. 
  - The `mtls-auth` plugin had a potential exploit associated with with CVE-2020-1971, but it would require an attacker to control a trusted CA or have admin port access, which [we recommend you block from attackers](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/secure-admin-api/) for numerous reasons. The updated OpenSSL version in this release additionally protects the `mtls-auth` plugin.
  - As a precautionary measure, we have bumped the OpenSSL dependency version to OpenSSL 1.1.1i.
  
#### Kong Enterprise
- RCE (Remote Code Execution) Plugin Mitigations: 
  Several Kong plugins allow arbitrary code execution by design, including the `serverless` plugin (also known as `pre-function` and `post-function` capabilities) and the `exit-transformer` plugin (for example, allows an administrator to configure a Lua-based response transformation). Changes include:
  - A new change in this release locks down these plugins so that they have limited functions available in a sandbox, providing significant additional security for a user with an exposed admin port.
  - Functions such as "require" are no longer available to scripts that run in these plugins for security purposes, because allowing "require" allows embedded additional arbitrary code execution. 
  - **Important**: This change causes a **breaking change** in this patch release and it cannot be avoided. Our recommendation is that [users lock down their admin ports](https://docs.konghq.com/latest/secure-admin-api/) to avoid attackers trying to exploit any API gateway, like Kong, to gain access to internal networks. If you need the previous release behavior, including the ability to arbitrarily "require" libraries or if you want to lock things down further, we have introduced four new settings you can use:
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA = on|off` Sets whether any custom Lua code can be used outside of Kong's distributed code. Defaults to "on".
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX = on|off` Turns on or off the sandbox. Defaults to "on".
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX_REQUIRES = foo,bar` Which libraries, if any, you want to require in the sandbox. Defaults to an empty list.
    - `KONG_UNTRUSTED_LUA_SANDBOX_ENVIRONMENT = kong.request` Any additional objects you want to pass through to the sandbox environments.  Defaults to an empty list.
  
#### Breaking Changes

## 1.3
**Release Date:** 2019/11/05

### Kong Gateway
- **Kong Enterprise 1.3** inherits the following changes from **Kong Gateway 1.3**:

### Changes

#### Dependencies

- The required OpenResty version has been bumped to
  [1.15.8.1](http://openresty.org/en/changelog-1015008.html). If you are
  installing Kong from one of our distribution packages, you are not affected
  by this change. See [#4382](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4382).
  With this new version comes a number of improvements:
  * The new [ngx\_http\_grpc\_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_grpc_module.html).
  * Configurable of upstream keepalive connections by timeout or number of
    requests.
  * Support for ARM64 architectures.
  * LuaJIT GC64 mode for x86_64 architectures, raising the LuaJIT GC-managed
    memory limit from 2GB to 128TB and producing more predictable GC
    performance.
- From this version on, the new
  [lua-kong-nginx-module](https://github.com/Kong/lua-kong-nginx-module) Nginx
  module is **required** to be built into OpenResty for Kong to function
  properly. This new module allows Kong to support new features such as mutual
  TLS authentication. If you are installing Kong from one of our distribution
  packages, you are not affected by this change.
  [openresty-build-tools#26](https://github.com/Kong/openresty-build-tools/pull/26)

**Note:** if you are not using one of our distribution packages and compiling
OpenResty from source, you must still apply Kong's [OpenResty
patches](https://github.com/kong/openresty-patches) (and, as highlighted above,
compile OpenResty with the new lua-kong-nginx-module). Our new
[openresty-build-tools](https://github.com/Kong/openresty-build-tools)
repository will allow you to do both easily.

#### Core

- Bugfixes in the router *may, in some edge-cases*, result in
  different Routes being matched. It was reported to us that the router behaved
  incorrectly in some cases when configuring wildcard Hosts and regex paths
  (e.g. [#3094](https://github.com/Kong/kong/issues/3094)). It may be so that
  you are subject to these bugs without realizing it. Please ensure that
  wildcard Hosts and regex paths Routes you have configured are matching as
  expected before upgrading.
  See [9ca4dc0](https://github.com/Kong/kong/commit/9ca4dc09fdb12b340531be8e0f9d1560c48664d5),
  [2683b86](https://github.com/Kong/kong/commit/2683b86c2f7680238e3fe85da224d6f077e3425d), and
  [6a03e1b](https://github.com/Kong/kong/commit/6a03e1bd95594716167ccac840ff3e892ed66215)
  for details.
- Upstream connections are now only kept-alive for 100 requests or 60 seconds
  (idle) by default. Previously, upstream connections were not actively closed
  by Kong. This is a (non-breaking) change in behavior, inherited from Nginx
  1.15, and configurable via new configuration properties (see below).

#### Configuration

- The `upstream_keepalive` configuration property is deprecated, and
  replaced by the new `nginx_http_upstream_keepalive` property. Its behavior is
  almost identical, but the notable difference is that the latter leverages the
  [injected Nginx
  directives](https://konghq.com/blog/kong-ce-nginx-injected-directives/)
  feature added in Kong 0.14.0.
  In future releases, we will gradually increase support for injected Nginx
  directives. We have high hopes that this will remove the occasional need for
  custom Nginx configuration templates.
  [#4382](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4382)

### Additions

#### Core

- **Native gRPC proxying.** Two new protocol types; `grpc` and
  `grpcs` correspond to gRPC over h2c and gRPC over h2. They can be specified
  on a Route or a Service's `protocol` attribute (e.g. `protocol = grpcs`).
  When an incoming HTTP/2 request matches a Route with a `grpc(s)` protocol,
  the request will be handled by the
  [ngx\_http\_grpc\_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_grpc_module.html),
  and proxied to the upstream Service according to the gRPC protocol
  specifications.  :warning: Note that not all Kong plugins are compatible with
  gRPC requests yet.  [#4801](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4801)
- **Mutual TLS** handshake with upstream services. The Service
  entity now has a new `client_certificate` attribute, which is a foreign key
  to a Certificate entity. If specified, Kong will use the Certificate as a
  client TLS cert during the upstream TLS handshake.
  [#4800](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4800)
- **Route by any request header**. The router now has the ability
  to match Routes by any request header (not only `Host`). The Route entity now
  has a new `headers` attribute, which is a map of headers names and values.
  E.g. `{ "X-Forwarded-Host": ["example.org"], "Version": ["2", "3"] }`.
  [#4758](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4758)
- **Least-connection load-balancing**. A new `algorithm` attribute
  has been added to the Upstream entity. It can be set to `"round-robin"`
  (default), `"consistent-hashing"`, or `"least-connections"`.
  [#4528](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4528)
- Healthchecks now use the combination of IP + Port + Hostname when storing
  upstream health information. Previously, only IP + Port were used. This means
  that different virtual hosts served behind the same IP/port will be treated
  differently with regards to their health status. New endpoints were added to
  the Admin API to manually set a Target's health status.
  [#4792](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4792)

#### Configuration

- A new section in the `kong.conf` file describes [injected Nginx
  directives](https://konghq.com/blog/kong-ce-nginx-injected-directives/)
  (added to Kong 0.14.0) and specifies a few default ones.
  In future releases, we will gradually increase support for injected Nginx
  directives. We have high hopes that this will remove the occasional need for
  custom Nginx configuration templates.
  [#4382](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4382)
- New configuration properties allow for controling the behavior of
  upstream keepalive connections. `nginx_http_upstream_keepalive_requests` and
  `nginx_http_upstream_keepalive_timeout` respectively control the maximum
  number of proxied requests and idle timeout of an upstream connection.
  [#4382](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4382)
- New flags have been added to the `*_listen` properties: `deferred`, `bind`,
  and `reuseport`.
  [#4692](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4692)

#### Admin API

- Many endpoints now support more levels of nesting for ease of access.
  For example: `/services/:services/routes/:routes` is now a valid API
  endpoint.
  [#4713](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4713)
- The API now accepts `form-urlencoded` payloads with deeply nested data
  structures. Previously, it was only possible to send such data structures
  via JSON payloads.
  [#4768](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4768)

#### Plugins

- jwt-auth: The new `header_names` property accepts an array of header names
  the JWT plugin should inspect when authenticating a request. It defaults to
  `["Authorization"]`.
  [#4757](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4757)
- [azure-functions](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-azure-functions):
  Bumped to 0.4 for minor fixes and performance improvements.
- [kubernetes-sidecar-injector](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-sidecar-injector):
  The plugin is now more resilient to Kubernetes schema changes. Note that it is
  now deprecated, and that Kong recommends using kuma.io instead.
- [serverless-functions](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-serverless-functions):
    - Bumped to 0.3 for minor performance improvements.
    - Functions can now have upvalues.
- [prometheus](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-prometheus): Bumped to
  0.4.1 for minor performance improvements.
- cors: add OPTIONS, TRACE and CONNECT to default allowed methods
  [#4899](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4899)
  Thanks to [@eshepelyuk](https://github.com/eshepelyuk) for the patch!
- upstream-tls: The Upstream TLS plugin is deprecated as of Kong Enterprise 1.3.0.0 and is only functional with Kong Enterprise versions 0.35 and 0.36. Be sure to remove this plugin before upgrading to the 1.5.x release to avoid errors or issues with your upgrade, as the plugin will no longer be supported.

#### PDK

- New function `kong.service.set_tls_cert_key()`. This functions sets the
  client TLS certificate used while handshaking with the upstream service.
  [#4797](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4797)

### Fixes

#### Core

- Router: Fixed a bug causing invalid matches when configuring two or more
  Routes with a plain `hosts` attribute shadowing another Route's wildcard
  `hosts` attribute. Details of the issue can be seen in
  [01b1cb8](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4775/commits/01b1cb871b1d84e5e93c5605665b68c2f38f5a31).
  [#4775](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4775)
- Router: Ensure regex paths always have priority over plain paths. Details of
  the issue can be seen in
  [2683b86](https://github.com/Kong/kong/commit/2683b86c2f7680238e3fe85da224d6f077e3425d).
  [#4775](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4775)
- Cleanup of expired rows in PostgreSQL is now much more efficient thanks to a
  new query plan.
  [#4716](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4716)
- Improved various query plans against Cassandra instances by increasing the
  default page size.
  [#4770](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4770)

#### Plugins

- cors: ensure non-preflight OPTIONS requests can be proxied.
  [#4899](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4899)
  Thanks to [@eshepelyuk](https://github.com/eshepelyuk) for the patch!
- Consumer references in various plugin entities are now
  properly marked as required, avoiding credentials that map to no Consumer.
  [#4879](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4879)
- hmac-auth: Correct the encoding of HTTP/1.0 requests.
  [#4839](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4839)
- oauth2: empty client_id wasn't checked, causing a server error.
  [#4884](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4884)
- response-transformer: preserve empty arrays correctly.
  [#4901](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4901)

#### CLI

- Fixed an issue when running `kong restart` and Kong was not running,
  causing stdout/stderr logging to turn off.
  [#4772](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4772)

#### Admin API

- Ensure PUT works correctly when applied to plugin configurations.
  [#4882](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4882)

#### PDK

- Prevent PDK calls from failing in custom content blocks.
  This fixes a misbehavior affecting the Prometheus plugin.
  [#4904](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4904)
- Ensure `kong.response.add_header` works in the `rewrite` phase.
  [#4888](https://github.com/Kong/kong/pull/4888)

### Enterprise-Exclusives

#### Changes

- Kong Service Mesh is transitioned and upgraded to our next-generation service mesh offering named “Kuma”. Go to kuma.io for more information about using Kuma.
- Phone home logging now uses a new shared dict: lua_shared_dict kong_reports_workspaces 1m;  If you use a custom nginx template, make sure it's there if you use phl.
- To configure Upstream TLS, use the NGINX directives [`proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_ssl_trusted_certificate), [`proxy_ssl_verify`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_ssl_verify), and [`proxy_ssl_verify_depth`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_ssl_verify_depth) instead of the Upstream TLS plugin. The plugin is only functional for versions 0.35 and 0.36.

- LDAP Auth Advanced - fixed issue where plugin tries to start a secure connection on an existing pooled connection from previous requests

##### Request Transformer Advanced

- Fixes a bug where the plugin was returning an empty body in the response for status codes outside of those specified in `config.replace.if_status`. For example, if we specified a `config.replace.if_status=404` and a body `config.replace.body=test` and the status code was 200, the response would be empty.

#### Kong Enterprise Gateway

- Fixes: audit log entries did not include timestamps indicating when the event occurred.
- Fixes: allow put requests to nonexistent foreign entities.
- Fixes: granular tracing did not work when certain plugins (for example, the key-auth) were used.

#### Docker

- Fixes: centos and alpine images did not work on some OpenShift setups with relaxed anyuid SCC settings.

## 0.36

### Notifications
- **Kong Enterprise 0.36** inherits from **Kong 1.2.1** with some exceptions:
  * Declarative Configuration and DB-less mode of Kong Gateway is designed for limited scenarios that do not allow for the Kong Enterprise to function as-is. As such the mode is not available in Kong Enterprise today.

**Release Date:** 2019/8/5

### Features

#### Core

- Support for **wildcard SNI matching**: the
  `ssl_certificate_by_lua` phase and the stream `preread` phase) is now able to
  match a client hello SNI against any registered wildcard SNI. This is
  particularly helpful for deployments serving a certificate for multiple
  subdomains.
- **HTTPS Routes can now be matched by SNI**: the `snis` Route
  attribute (previously only available for `tls` Routes) can now be set for
  `https` Routes and is evaluated by the HTTP router.
- **Native support for HTTPS redirects**: Routes have a new
  `https_redirect_status_code` attribute specifying the status code to send
  back to the client if a plain text request was sent to an `https` Route.
- Schema fields can now be marked as immutable.
- Support for loading custom DAO strategies from plugins.
- Support for IPv6 to `tcp` and `tls` Routes.
- **Transparent proxying** - the `service` attribute on
  Routes is now optional; a Route without an assigned Service will
  proxy transparently
- Support for **tags** in entities
  - Every core entity now adds a `tags` field
- New `protocols` field in the Plugin entity, allowing plugin instances
  to be set for specific protocols only (`http`, `https`, `tcp` or `tls`).
  - It filters out plugins during execution according to their `protocols` field
  - It throws an error when trying to associate a Plugin to a Route
    which is not compatible, protocols-wise, or to a Service with no
    compatible routes.

#### Configuration

- **Asynchronous router updates**: a new configuration property
  `router_consistency` accepts two possible values: `strict` and `eventual`.
  The former is the default setting and makes router rebuilds highly
  consistent between Nginx workers. It can result in long tail latency if
  frequent Routes and Services updates are expected. The latter helps
  preventing long tail latency issues by instructing Kong to rebuild the router
  asynchronously (with eventual consistency between Nginx workers).
- **Database cache warmup**: Kong can now preload entities during
  its initialization. A new configuration property (`db_cache_warmup_entities`)
  was introduced, allowing users to specify which entities should be preloaded.
  DB cache warmup allows for ahead-of-time DNS resolution for Services with a
  hostname. This feature reduces first requests latency, improving the overall
  P99 latency tail.
- Improved PostgreSQL connection management: two new configuration properties
  have been added: `pg_max_concurrent_queries` sets the maximum number of
  concurrent queries to the database, and `pg_semaphore_timeout` allows for
  tuning the timeout when acquiring access to a database connection. The
  default behavior remains the same, with no concurrency limitation.
- New option in `kong.conf`: `pg_schema` to specify Postgres schema
  to be used
- The Stream subsystem now supports Nginx directive injections
  - `nginx_stream_*` (or `KONG_NGINX_STREAM_*` environment variables)
    for injecting entries to the `stream` block
  - `nginx_sproxy_*` (or `KONG_NGINX_SPROXY_*` environment variables)
    for injecting entries to the `server` block inside `stream`

#### Admin API

- Add a **schema validation endpoint for entities**: a new
  endpoint `/schemas/:entity_name/validate` can be used to validate an instance
  of any entity type in Kong without creating the entity itself.
- Add **memory statistics** to the `/status` endpoint. The response
  now includes a `memory` field, which contains the `lua_shared_dicts` and
  `workers_lua_vms` fields with statistics on shared dictionaries and workers
  Lua VM memory usage.
  - When using the new `database=off` configuration option,
    the Admin API endpoints for entities (such as `/routes` and
    `/services`) are read-only, since the configuration can only
    be updated via `/config`
- Admin API endpoints now support searching by tag
  (for example, `/consumers?tags=example_tag`)
  - You can search by multiple tags:
     - `/services?tags=serv1,mobile` to search for services matching tags `serv1` and `mobile`
     - `/services?tags=serv1/serv2` to search for services matching tags `serv1` or `serv2`
- New Admin API endpoint `/tags/` for listing entities by tag: `/tags/example_tag`

#### PDK

- New function `kong.node.get_memory_stats()`. This function returns statistics
  on shared dictionaries and workers Lua VM memory usage, and powers the memory
  statistics newly exposed by the `/status` endpoint.
- New PDK function: `kong.client.get_protocol` for obtaining the protocol
  in use during the current request
- New PDK function: `kong.nginx.get_subsystem`, so plugins can detect whether
  they are running on the HTTP or Stream subsystem

#### Plugins

- Logging plugins: log request TLS version, cipher, and verification status.
- Plugin development: inheriting from `BasePlugin` is now optional. Avoiding
  the inheritance paradigm improves plugins' performance.
- Support for ACL **authenticated groups**, so that authentication plugins
  that use a 3rd party (other than Kong) to store credentials can benefit
  from using a central ACL plugin to do authorization for them.
- The Kubernetes Sidecar Injection plugin is now bundled into Kong for a
  smoother K8s experience.
- AWS Lambda now includes the AWS China region.

#### CLI

- **Bulk database import** using the same declarative
  configuration format as the in-memory mode, using the new command:
  `kong config db_import kong.yml`. This command upserts all
  entities specified in the given `kong.yml` file in bulk.
   * Known issue for db_import/db_export in Kong Enterprise
      - `db_import` supports all API Gateway entities, with the exception of Admins and RBAC users and roles. This limitation is because credentials are hashed.
      - `db_export` is not supported at all.
- New command: `kong config init` to generate a template `kong.yml`
  file to get you started
- New command: `kong config parse kong.yml` to verify the syntax of
  the `kong.yml` file before using it
- New option `--wait` in `kong quit` to ease graceful termination when using orchestration tools.

### Fixes

#### Core

- Resolve hostnames properly during initialization of Cassandra contact points
- Fix health checks for Targets that need two-level DNS resolution
  (e.g. SRV → A → IP)
- Fix serialization of map types in the Cassandra backend
- Fix target cleanup and cascade-delete for Targets
- Avoid crash when failing to obtain list of Upstreams
- Disallow invalid timeout value of 0ms for attributes in Services
- DAO fix for foreign fields used as primary keys
- Cassandra: ensures serial consistency is `LOCAL_SERIAL` when a
  datacenter-aware load balancing policy is in use. This fixes unavailability
  exceptions sometimes experienced when connecting to a multi-datacenter
  cluster with cross-datacenter connectivity issues.
- Schemas: fixes an issue in the schema validator that would not allow specifying
  `false` in some schema rules, such a `{ type = "boolean", eq = false }`.
- Fixes an underlying issue with regards to database entities cache keys
  generation.
- Ensure the migration path for Cassandra does not corrupt the
  database schema.
- Allow the `kong config init` command to run without a pointing to a prefix
  directory.
- Adds support for [`db_cache_warmup_entities`](/enterprise/0.36-x/property-reference/#db_cache_warmup_entities),
  which allows Kong to pre-load all necessary entries into Kong nodes' memory on start.
- Provides support in declarative configuration for **Workspaces** and **RBAC**.
- Provides support for the Redis Cluster library.
- Active healthchecks: `http` checks are not performed for `tcp` and `tls`
  Services anymore; only `tcp` healthchecks are performed against such
  Services.
- Fix an issue where updates in migrations would not correctly populate default
  values.
- Improvements in the reentrancy of Cassandra migrations.
- Fix an issue causing the PostgreSQL strategy to not bootstrap the schema when
  using a PostgreSQL account with limited permissions.
- Address issue where field type "record" nested values reset on update
- Correctly manage primary keys of type "foreign"

#### Admin API

- Proper support for `PUT /{entities}/{entity}/plugins/{plugin}`
- Fix Admin API inferencing of map types using form-encoded
- Accept UUID-like values in `/consumers?custom_id=`

#### Dev Portal

- Adds *per workspace* **Session Config**. The Dev Portal will now allow
session configuration for every portal-per-workspace instance.
- Adds **email verification**. Developers will be sent a verification link after
requesting access to a Dev Portal.

#### Plugins

- **Request Validator**
  - Adds support for JSON Schema Draft 4
  - Adds support for parameter validation
  - Adds the option to override validation for specific content types
- **OAuth2 Introspection**
  - Can now find and load consumers by `username` and `custom_id`. OAuth2
  `username` maps to **Consumer's** `username`, while the `client_id` maps to a
  **Consumer's** `custom_id`
  - New `consumer_by` configuration allows users to customize whether **Consumers**
  are fetched by `client_id` or `username` (returned by the introspection request)
  - New `introspect_request` configuration that causes the plugin to send
  information about the **current request** as **headers** in the **introspection endpoint**
  **request**. Currently, the **request path** and **HTTP methods** are sent as `X-Request-Path`
  and `X-Request-Http-Method` headers
  - New `custom_introspection_headers` configuration list of user-supplied
  headers to be sent in the **introspection endpoint request**
  - New `custom_claims_forward` configuration list of additional claims. The
  **introspection endpoint request** will return this list to forward as headers
  to the **upstream service request**.
- basic-auth, ldap-auth, key-auth, jwt, hmac-auth: fixed
  status code for unauthorized requests: they now return HTTP 401
  instead of 403
- tcp-log: remove spurious trailing carriage return
- jwt: fix `typ` handling for supporting JOSE (JSON Object
  Signature and Validation)
- Fixes to the best-effort auto-converter for legacy plugin schemas
- Ensures the `cassandra_local_datacenter` configuration property is specified
  when a datacenter-aware Cassandra load balancing policy is in use.
- request-transformer: fixes an issue that would prevent adding a body to
  requests without one.
- kubernetes-sidecar-injector: fixes an issue causing mutating webhook calls to
  fail.
- basic-auth: ignore password if nil on basic auth credential patch
- http-log: Simplify queueing mechanism. Fixed a bug where traces were lost
  in some cases.
- request-transformer: validate header values in plugin configuration.
- rate-limiting: added index on rate-limiting metrics.
- **Upstream-tls**
  - Fixes an issue where bundled **certificates** in PEM format were not loaded into
  the certificate store correctly.
- ldap-auth: ensure TLS connections are reused.
- oauth2: ensured access tokens preserve their `token_expiration` value when
  migrating from previous Kong versions.

#### Workspaces

- Fixes permission bug where an **Admin** with `workspace-super-admin` **Role** was
not able to access the **Workspace** that the **Role** was assigned to.

#### Upstreams

- Fixes an issue where it was not possible to delete an **Upstream** object if it had no associated **Target**.

#### Kong Manager

- Fixes a bug where Kong Manager could only display 100 **Workspaces**.
- Fixes a bug where a **Route's** details would not include a link to a **Service** that did not have a name.

#### Dev Portal

- Fixes a bug in the sign-up meta fields that caused data to disappear when a **Developer** is updated.
- Fixes an issue where clicking on a **Developer** after clicking the credentials section ACL causes a 500 error.

#### CLI

- Fix `kong db_import` to support inserting entities without specifying a UUID
  for their primary key. Entities with a unique identifier (e.g. `name` for
  Services) can have their primary key omitted.
- The `kong migrations [up|finish] -f` commands does not run anymore if there
  are no previously executed migrations.

## 0.35-1
**Release Date:** 2019/05/28

### Notifications
- **Kong Enterprise 0.35-1** inherits from **Kong 1.0.3**; read the
[Kong Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#103)
for details.

### Features

#### Plugins
  - Allow **Redis** strategy configuration for **Rate Limiting Advanced**

### Fixes

#### Kong Manager
- If a Kong Manager **Super Admin** was already created, setting
`KONG_PASSWORD` during `migrations up` to **0.35** would error. Running
migrations when **Super Admin** already exists and `KONG_PASSWORD`
environment variable is set is fixed.

#### Dev Portal
- Fixes Dev Portal documentation not showing after upgrading to 0.35
- Fixes Dev Portal OAPI spec rendering of long request URL wrapping

#### Plugins
- `rate-limiting-advanced` schema validation rules prevented use of
Redis Sentinel (`config.strategy=redis` and
`config.redis.sentinel_addresses`) for counters datastore. Validation
rule is fixed.

#### Core
- Upgrade from **0.34-1** to **0.35** using **Cassandra** no longer creates
duplicate **Workspace**.
- Migrations from **0.34-1**to **0.35** did not properly handle **Certificates**
and **SNIs** in context of **Workspaces**. Migrating from **0.34-1** with
this fix does not support zero downtime in this release. To get a fully
functional **0.35** instance with **Certificates**, you must run `migrations
finish`. Proper creation of **Workspace** links for **Certificates** and
**SNIs** is fixed.
- **Cassandra** `read before write` pattern did not correctly use schema
defaults and prevented `PATCH` of the **Plugins** entity. Usage of schema
default values in **Cassandra** `read before write` pattern is fixed.
- `plugins.run_on default` now correctly set on migrations upgrade.
<hr/>

## 0.35
**Release Date:** 2019/05/17

### Notifications
- **Kong Enterprise 0.35** inherits from **Kong 1.0.3**; read the
[Kong Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#103)
for details.

### Changes

#### Admin API
  - **RBAC**: Following Kong 1.0's changes, referenced (`foreign_key`) entities
  like RBAC Users and RBAC Roles are returned as nested JSON tables instead of
  flattened `role_id` or `user_id` fields in top-level entity.
  - `user_token` must now be provided when creating a new **RBAC** user (in a
  POST request to `rbac/users`) and is no longer auto-generated if left blank

#### Core
  - New **RBAC** user tokens are not stored in plaintext. If upgrading to this
  version, any existing tokens will remain in plaintext until either a) the
  token is used in an Admin API call or b) the `rbac_user` record is PATCHed
  even if the PATCH request includes the existing value of `user_token`).

### Features

#### Kong Manager
  - User information is no longer stored in local storage. A user exchanges
  credentials for a session. See the [**Session Plugin**](/hub/kong-inc/sessions)
  for details.
  - Enable and view **Plugins** in context of a **Service** and **Route**
  - Type-ahead service name/ID search on routes form
  - Easily scan/copy IDs in service table
  - Contextual help and error messages for forms
  - Adds page breadcrumbs
  - In-context documentation links
  - Global navigation links to documentation and Support Portal
  - Improved Info tab for cluster & config info
  - Detailed debug tracing can be enabled which outputs information about
  various portions of the request lifecycle, such as DB or DNS queries,
  plugin execution, core handler timing, etc

#### Dev Portal
  - **Dev Portal** files now rendered server-side for increased performance.
  - Developers can now sign up to multiple **Workspaces** with the same email
  address.
  - **Dev Portal** is disabled for each **Workspace** by default.
  - Default theme shipped with **Kong Enterprise** now supports IE11.
  - User information is no longer stored in local storage. A user exchanges
  credentials for a session. See the [**Session Plugin**](/hub/kong-in/sessions)
  for details.
  - **Dev Portal** page, partial, and specification look-ups moved to
  server-side.
  - Added support for OAS3 body parameters.
  - Added CORS header configuration option to workspace portal configuration
  object to allow explicit CORS configuration.
  - Added a live editor built on VSCode core for improved customization of
  **Dev Portal** within **Kong Manager**
  - Added custom registration fields support and custom registration field
  interface.
  - Added methods to links in the sidebar on documentation in the default portal
  theme.
  - Added hover states to drop-downs in the sidebar of documentation in the
  default portal theme.
  - Added a right border to the sidebar in the default portal theme.
  - Changed `full Name` registration field to be a custom registration field,
  and can be managed through the custom fields interface in **Kong Manager**.
  - Changed custom checkbox to native checkbox in the default **Dev Portal**
  theme on the dashboard.

#### Plugins
  - **Response Transformer Advanced** (_NEW_):
    - Conditional transformations on response status through the new flag
    if_status, a subfield in all transformations (e.g., `add.if_status`,
    `remove.if_status`); the transformation only happens if the response code
    matches one of the codes in the `if_status field`
    - Full-body replacement through the new config.replace.body
    - Added a support of status code ranges for `if_status` configuration
    parameter. Now you can provide status code ranges and single status codes
    together (e.g., `201-204,401`)
  - **Request Validator** (_NEW_):
    - Validate the request body against a schema; if the payload is not
    valid JSON or if it doesn't conform to the schema, the plugin returns a 400
    Bad Request response before the request reaches upstream. This version of
    the plugin **does not** support JSON Schema; it uses Kong's schema format
  - **Canary**:
    - Healthchecks: new configuration upstream_fallback allows the plugin to
    skip applying the canary upstream if it's not healthy. Note: it only works
    if the host specified in upstream_host points to a Kong upstream, and if
    that upstream has healthchecks enabled on it)
  - **Oauth2 Introspection**:
    - Set Id to Rate limiting may detect calls to introspection endpoint
    - Set credential id to allow rate limiting based on access token
  - **The Kong Session Plugin**:
    - The Kong Session Plugin adds session support for **Kong Manager** and
    Dev Portal. Sessions can be stored via cookie or database. See the
    accompanying documentation for how to configure the plugin for use with
    **Kong Manager**.
  - **Vault-Auth**:
    - Authenticate requests via Vault. See
    [**Vault Auth**](/hub/kong-inc/vault-auth) for details.
  - **OpenID Connect**:
    - Update `lua-resty-http` to `>= 0.13`
    - Update `lua-resty-session` to `2.23`
    - Add `config.authorization_endpoint`
    - Add `config.token_endpoint`

## 0.34-1
**Release Date:** 2018/12/19

### Notifications
- **Kong EE 0.34** inherits from **Kong CE 0.13.1**; make sure to read 0.13.1 - and 0.13.0 - changelogs:
  - [0.13.0 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0130---20180322)
  - [0.13.1 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0131---20180423)
- **Kong EE 0.34** has these notices from **Kong CE 0.13**:
  - Support for **Postgres 9.4 has been removed** - starting with 0.32, Kong Enterprise does not start with Postgres 9.4 or prior
  - Support for **Cassandra 2.1 has been deprecated, but Kong will still start** - versions beyond 0.33 will not start with Cassandra 2.1 or prior
      - **Dev Portal** requires Cassandra 3.0+
  - **Galileo - DEPRECATED**: Galileo plugin is deprecated and will reach EOL soon

### Changes
- **Kong Manager**
  - Email addresses are stored in lower-case. These addresses must be case-insensitively unique. In previous versions, you could store mixed case email addresses. A migration for Postgres converts all existing email addresses to lower case. Cassandra users should review the email address of their admins and developers and update them to lower-case if necessary. Use the Kong Manager or the Admin API to make these updates.
- **Plugins**
  - **Forward Proxy**
    - Do not do a DNS request to the original upstream that would be discarded anyway as proxy will manage the resolving of the configured host.
  - **OpenID Connect**
    - Remove obsolete daos (adds migration)
    - Hide secret from Admin API (used with sessions)
    - Bump lua-resty-session to 2.23

## 0.34
**Release Date:** 2018/11/17

### Notifications
- **Kong EE 0.34** inherits from **Kong CE 0.13.1**; make sure to read 0.13.1 - and 0.13.0 - changelogs:
  - [0.13.0 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0130---20180322)
  - [0.13.1 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0131---20180423)
- **Kong EE 0.34** has these notices from **Kong CE 0.13**:
  - Support for **Postgres 9.4 has been removed** - starting with 0.32, Kong Enterprise does not start with Postgres 9.4 or prior
  - Support for **Cassandra 2.1 has been deprecated, but Kong will still start** - versions beyond 0.33 will not start with Cassandra 2.1 or prior

### Changes
- **Admin API**
  - The system-generated `default` role for an RBAC user is no longer accessible via the Admin API
  - Auto-config OAPI endpoint available for Admin API (configure services & routes via Swagger)
- **Workspaces**

    ```
    custom_plugins=openid-connect-verification,openid-connect-authentication,openid-connect-protection
    ```
    Or the following environment variable:
    ```

    ```
    The all-in-one version of OIDC is enabled by default (and is not deprecated).

    - Always log the original error message when authorization code flow verification fails

## 0.33-1
**Release Date:** 2018/09/05

### Notifications

- **Kong EE 0.33** inherits from **Kong CE 0.13.1**; make sure to read 0.13.1 - and 0.13.0 - changelogs:
  - [0.13.0 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0130---20180322)
  - [0.13.1 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0131---20180423)
- **Kong EE 0.33** has these notices from **Kong CE 0.13**:
  - Support for **Postgres 9.4 has been removed** - starting with 0.32, Kong Enterprise does not start with Postgres 9.4 or prior
  - Support for **Cassandra 2.1 has been deprecated, but Kong will still start** - versions beyond 0.33 will not start with Cassandra 2.1 or prior
      - **Dev Portal** requires Cassandra 3.0+
  - **Galileo - DEPRECATED**: Galileo plugin is deprecated and will reach EOL soon
- **Breaking**: Since 0.32, the `latest` tag in Kong Enterprise Docker repository **changed from CentOS to Alpine** - which might result in breakage if additional packages are assumed to be in the image pointed to by `latest`, as the Alpine image only contains a minimal set of packages installed by default

    - **Healthchecks**
      - Fix Host header in active healthchecks
      - Fix for connection timeouts on passive healthchecks
  - **Dev Portal**
      - Fix issue leading migrations `2018-04-10-094800_dev_portal_consumer_types_statuses` and `2018-05-08-143700_consumer_dev_portal_columns` to fail
      - Automatically log users in after registering when auto-approve is on
      - Reduce the size of the mobile breakpoint

  - **Proxy Cache**
      - Fix issue leading to cache key collision in some scenarios - e.g., for requests issued by the same consumer
      - Fix cache key for Routes and Services: previously, distinct routes/services entities would be given the same cache key

## 0.33
**Release Date:** 2018/07/24

### Notifications

- **Kong EE 0.33** inherits from **Kong CE 0.13.1**; make sure to read 0.13.1 - and 0.13.0 - changelogs:
  - [0.13.0 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0130---20180322)
  - [0.13.1 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0131---20180423)
- **Kong EE 0.33** has these notices from **Kong CE 0.13**:
  - Support for **Postgres 9.4 has been removed** - starting with 0.32, Kong Enterprise does not start with Postgres 9.4 or prior
  - Support for **Cassandra 2.1 has been deprecated, but Kong will still start** - versions beyond 0.33 will not start with Cassandra 2.1 or prior
  - Additional requirements:
      - **Vitals** requires Postgres 9.5+
      - **Dev Portal** requires Cassandra 3.0+
  - **Galileo - DEPRECATED**: Galileo plugin is deprecated and will reach EOL soon

      - `consumer_optional`: optional, default: `false`
- **StatsD Plugin**
  - New plugin; see documentation [here][statsd-docs]

## 0.32
**Release Date:** 2018/05/24

### Notifications

- **Kong EE 0.32** inherits from **Kong CE 0.13.1**; make sure to read 0.13.1 - and 0.13.0 - changelogs:
  - [0.13.0 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0130---20180322)
  - [0.13.1 Changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0131---20180423)
- **Kong EE 0.32** has these notices from **Kong CE 0.13**:
  - Support for **Postgres 9.4 has been removed** - starting with 0.32, Kong Enterprise will not start with Postgres 9.4 or prior
  - Support for **Cassandra 2.1 has been deprecated, but Kong will still start** - versions beyond 0.33 will not start with Cassandra 2.1 or prior
  - Additional requirements:
      - **Vitals** requires Postgres 9.5+
      - **Dev Portal** requires Cassandra 3.0+
  - **Galileo - DEPRECATED**: Galileo plugin is deprecated and will reach EOL soon
- **Breaking**: The `latest` tag in Kong Enterprise Docker repository changed from CentOS to Alpine - which might result in breakage if additional packages are assumed to be in the image, as the Alpine image only contains a minimal set of packages installed
- **OpenID Connect**
  - The plugins listed below were deprecated in favor of the all-in-one openid-connect plugin:
      - `openid-connect-authentication`
      - `openid-connect-protection`
      - `openid-connect-verification`

### Changes

- **New Data Model** - Kong EE 0.32 is the first Enterprise version including the [**new model**](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#core-2), released with Kong CE 0.13, which includes Routes and Services
- **Rate Limiting Advanced**
  - **Breaking** - the Enterprise Rate Limiting plugin, named `rate-limiting` up to EE 0.31, was renamed `rate-limiting-advanced` and CE Rate Limiting was imported as `rate-limiting`. Any Admin API calls that were previously targeting the Enterprise Rate Limiting plugin in Kong EE up to 0.31 need to be updated to target `rate-limiting-advanced`
  - Rate Limiting Advanced, similarly to CE rate-limiting, now uses a dedicated shared dictionary named `kong_rate_limiting_counters` for its counters; if you are using a custom template, make sure to define the following shared memory zones:

    ```
    lua_shared_dict kong_rate_limiting_counters 12m;
    ```
- **Vitals**
  - Vitals uses two dedicated shared dictionaries. If you use a custom template, define the following shared memory zones for Vitals:

    ```
    lua_shared_dict kong_vitals_counters 50m;
    lua_shared_dict kong_vitals_lists     1m;
    ```
  You can remove any existing shared dictionaries that begin with `kong_vitals_`, e.g., `kong_vitals_requests_consumers`
- **OpenID Connect**
  - Remove multipart parsing of ID tokens - they were not proxy safe
  - Change expired or non-active access tokens to give `401` instead of `403`

### Features

- **Admin GUI**
  - New Listeners (Admin GUI + Developer Portal)
  - Routes and Services GUI
  - New Plugins thumbnail view
  - Healthchecks GUI
  - Syntax for form-encoded array elements
  - Dev Portal Overview tab
  - Developers management tab
- **Vitals**

      - Status Codes per Service - count of individual status codes correlated to a particular service. Visible in the Admin GUI at `ADMIN_URL/services/{service_id}`
      - Status Codes per Route - count of individual status codes correlated to a particular route. Visible in the Admin GUI at `ADMIN_URL/routes/{route_id}`
      - Status Codes per Consumer and Route - count of individual status codes returned to a given consumer on a given route.  Visible in the Admin GUI at `ADMIN_URL/consumers/{consumer_id}`
- **Dev Portal**
  - Code Snippets
  - Developer "request access" full life-cycle
  - Default Dev Portal included in Kong distributions (with default theme)

  - **Requires Migration - Rate Limiting CE** is now included in EE
  - **Request Transformer CE** is now included in EE
  - **Edge Compute**: plugin-based, Lua-only preview
  - **Proxy Cache**: Customize the cache key, selecting specific headers or query params to be included
  - **Opentracing Plugin**: Kong now adds detailed spans to Zipkin and Jaeger distributed tracing tools
  - **Azure Functions Plugin**: Invoke Azure functions from Kong
  - **LDAP Advanced**: LDAP plugin with augmented ability to search by LDAP fields
- **OpenID Connect**
  - Add `self_check` function to validate that OIDC discovery information can be downloaded
  - Bearer token is now looked up on `Access-Token` and `X-Access-Token` headers in addition to Authorization Bearer header (query and body args are supported as before)
  - JWKs are rediscovered and the new keys are cached cluster wide (works better with keys rotation schemes)
  - Admin API does self-check for discovery endpoint when the plugin is added and reports possible errors back
  - Add configuration directives
      - `config.extra_jwks_uris`
      - `config.credential_claim`
      - `config.session_storage`
      - `config.session_memcache_prefix`
      - `config.session_memcache_socket`

      - `config.introspection_headers_values`
      - `config.token_exchange_endpoint`
      - `config.cache_token_exchange`
      - `config.bearer_token_param_type`
      - `config.client_credentials_param_type`
      - `config.password_param_type`
      - `config.hide_credentials`
      - `config.cache_ttl`
      - `config.run_on_preflight`

      - `config.upstream_headers_names`
      - `config.downstream_headers_claims`
      - `config.downstream_headers_names`

### Fixes

- **Core**
  - **Healthchecks**
      - Fix an issue where updates made through `/health` or `/unhealth` wouldn't be propagated to other Kong nodes
      - Fix internal management of healthcheck counters, which corrects detection of state flapping
  - **DNS**: a number of fixes and improvements were made to Kong's DNS client library, including:
      - The ring-balancer now supports `targets` resolving to an SRV record without port information (`port=0`)
      - IPv6 nameservers with a scope in their address (eg. `nameserver fe80::1%wlan0`) will now be skipped instead of throwing errors
- **Rate Limiting Advanced**
  - Fix `failed to upsert counters` error
  - Fix issue where an attempt to acquire a lock would result in an error
  - Mitigate issue where lock acquisitions would lead to RL counters being lost
- **Proxy Cache**
  - Fix issue where proxy-cache would shortcircuit requests that resulted in a cache hit, not allowing subsequent plugins - e.g., logging plugins - to run
  - Fix issue where PATCH requests would result in a 500 response
  - Fix issue where Proxy Cache would overwrite X-RateLimit headers
- **Request Transformer**
  - Fix issue leading to an Internal Server Error in cases where the Rate Limiting plugin returned a 429 Too Many Requests response
- **AWS Lambda**
  - Fix issue where an empty array `[]` was returned as an empty object `{}`
- **Galileo - DEPRECATED**
  - Fix issue that prevented Galileo from reporting requests that were cached by proxy-cache
  - Fix issue that prevented Galileo from showing request/response bodies of requests served by proxy-cache
- **OpenID Connect**
  - Fix `exp` retrieval
  - Fix `jwt_session_cookie` verification
  - Fix consumer mapping using introspection where the claim was searched in an inexistent location
  - Fix header values when their callbacks fail to get the value - instead of setting their values as `function ...`
  - Fix `config.scopes` when set to `null` or `""` so that it doesn't add an OpenID scope forcibly, as the plugin is not only OpenID Connect only, but also OAuth2
<hr/>

## 0.31-1
**Release Date:** 2018/04/25

### Changes

- New shared dictionaries named `kong_rl_counters` and `kong_db_cache_miss` were defined in Kong’s default template - customers using custom templates are encouraged to update them to include those, as they avoid the reuse of the `kong_cache` shared dict; such a reuse is known to be one of the culprits behind `no memory` errors - see diff below
- The rate-limiting plugin now accepts a `dictionary_name` argument, which is used for temporarily storing rate-limiting counters

*NOTE*: if you use a custom Nginx configuration template, apply the following patch to your template:

```
diff --git a/kong/templates/nginx_kong.lua b/kong/templates/nginx_kong.lua
index 15682975..653a7ddd 100644

```

### Fixes

- Bump mlcache to 2.0.2 and mitigates a number of issues known to be causing `no memory` errors
- Fixes an issue where boolean values (and boolean values as strings) were not correctly marshalled when using Cassandra
- Fixes an issue in Redis Sentinel configuration parsing

## 0.31

- Galileo plugin is disabled by default in this version, needing to be explicitly enabled via the custom_plugins configuration
  - *NOTE*: If a user had the Galileo plugin applied in an older version and migrate to 0.31, Kong will fail to restart unless the user enables it via the [custom_plugins](/latest/configuration/#custom_plugins) configuration; however, it is still possible to enable the plugin per API or globally without adding it to custom_plugins
- OpenID Connect plugin:
  - Change `config.client_secret` from `required` to `optional`
- Change `config.client_id` from `required` to `optional`
- If `anonymous` consumer is not found Internal Server Error is returned instead of Forbidden
- **Breaking Change** - `config.anonymous` now behaves similarly to other plugins and doesn't halt execution or proxying (previously it was used just as a fallback for consumer mapping) and the plugin always needed valid credentials to be allowed to proxy if the client wasn't already authenticated by higher priority auth plugin
- Anonymous consumer now uses a simple cache key that is used in other plugins
- In case of auth plugins concatenation, the OpenID Connect plugin now removes remnants of anonymous

### Fixes
- **Admin GUI**
  - Remove deprecated orderlist field from Admin GUI Upstreams entity settings
  - Fix issue where Admin GUI would break when running Kong in a custom prefix
  - Fix issue where Healthchecks had a field typed as number instead of string.
  - Fix issue where Healthchecks form had incorrect default values.
  - Fix issue where table row text was overflowing and expanding the page.
  - Fix issue where notification bar in mobile view could have text overflow beyond the container.
  - Fix issue where deleting multiple entities in a list would cause the delete modal to not show.
  - Fix issue where cards on the dashboard were not evenly sized and spaced.
  - Fix issue where cards on the dashboard in certain widths could have text overflow beyond their container.
  - Fix issue where Array's on Plugin Entities were not being processed and sent to the Admin API.
  - Fix issue where Models were improperly handled when not updated and not sending default values properly.
  - Fix issue where Plugin lists were not displaying config object.
  - Fix issue where Kong was not processing SSL configuration for Admin GUI

- **OpenID Connect plugin**
  - Fixed anonymous consumer mapping

- **Vitals**

  - Correct the stats returned in the "metadata" attribute of the /vitals/consumers/:consumer_id/* endpoints
  - Correct a problem where workers get out of sync when adding their data to cache
  - Correct inconsistencies in chart axes when toggling between views or when Kong has no traffic

- **Proxy Cache**
  - Fix issue that prevented cached requests from showing up in Vitals or Total Requests graphs
  - Fixes inherited from Kong Community Edition 0.12.3.

### Features
- Admin GUI
  - Add notification bar alerting users that their license is about to expire, and has expired.
  - Add new design to vitals overview, table breakdown, and a new tabbed chart interface.
  - Add top-level vitals section to the sidebar.

- Requires migration - Vitals
  - New datastore support: Cassandra 2.1+
  - Support for averages for Proxy Request Latency and Upstream Latency

- Requires migration - Dev Portal
  - Not-production-ready feature preview of:
    - "Public only" Portal - no authentication (eg. the portal is fully accessible to anyone who can access it)
    - Authenticated Portal - Developers must log in, and then they can see what they are entitled to see

## 0.30
**Release Date:** 2018/01/24

Kong Enterprise 0.30 is shipped with all the changes present in [Kong Community Edition 0.12.1](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0121---20180118), as well as with the following additions:

### Notifications

- EE 0.30 inherits dependency **deprecation** notices from CE 0.12. See the "Deprecation Notes" section of Kong 0.12.0 changelog
- ⚠️ By default, the Admin API now only listens on the local interface. We consider this change to be an improvement in the default security policy of Kong. If you are already using Kong, and your Admin API still binds to all interfaces, consider updating it as well. You can do so by updating the `admin_listen` configuration value, like so: `admin_listen = 127.0.0.1:8001`.

- 🔴 Note to Docker users: Beware of this change as you may have to ensure that your Admin API is reachable via the host's interface. You can use the `-e KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN` argument when provisioning your container(s) to update this value; for example, `-e KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8001`.

### Changes
- **Renaming of Enterprise plugin**
  - `request-transformer` becomes `request-transformer-advanced`

- **Rate-limiting** plugin
  - Change default `config.identifier` in EE's from `ip` to `consumer`

- **Vitals**
  - Aggregate minutes data at the same time as seconds data
  - **Breaking Change:** Replace previous Vitals API (part of the Admin API) with new version. **Not backwards compatible.**
  - **Upgrading from Kong EE (0.29) will result in the loss of previous Vitals data**

- **Admin GUI**
  - Vitals chart settings stored in local storage
  - Improve vital chart legends
  - Change Make A Wish email to <a href="mailto:wish@konghq.com`>wish@konghq.com</a>

- **OpenID Connect Plugins**
  - Change `config.login_redirect_uri` from `string` to `array`
  - Add new configuration parameters
    - config.authorization_query_args_client
    - config.client_arg
    - config.logout_redirect_uri
    - config.logout_query_arg
    - config.logout_post_arg
    - config.logout_uri_suffix
    - config.logout_methods
    - config.logout_revoke
    - config.revocation_endpoint
    - config.end_session_endpoint

- **OpenID Connect Library**
  - Function `authorization:basic` now return as a third parameter, the grant type if one was found - previously, it returned parameter location in HTTP request
  - Issuer is no longer verified on discovery as some IdPs report different value (it is still verified with claims verification)

**Added**

- New **Canary Release plugin**

- Vitals
  - Addition of "node-specific" dimension for previously-released metrics (Kong Request Latency and Datastore Cache)
  - New metrics and dimensions:
    - **Request Count per Consumer**, by Node or Cluster
    - **Total Request Count**, by Node or Cluster
    - **Upstream Latency** (the time between a request being sent upstream by Kong, and the response being received by Kong), by Node or Cluster
  - All new metrics and dimensions accessible in **Admin GUI and API**
  - **Important limitations and notifications:**
    - PostgreSQL 9.5+ only - no Cassandra support yet
    - Upgrading from the previous version of Kong EE will result in all historic Vitals data being dropped
    - The previous Vitals API (which is part of the Admin API) is replaced with a new, better one (the old API disappears, and there is no backwards compatibility)

  - **Proxy Cache**
    - Implement Redis (stand-alone and Sentinel) caching of proxy cache entities

  - **Enterprise Rate Limiting**
    - Provide **fixed-window** quota rate limiting (which is essentially what the CE rate-limiting plugin does) in addition to the current sliding window rate limiting
    - Add *hide_client_headers* configuration to disable response headers returned by the rate limiting plugin

  - **Admin GUI**
    - Addition of **"Form Control Grouping"** for the new Upstream health-check configuration options.
    - Add **Healthy** or **Unhealthy** buttons for the new health-check functionality on Upstream Targets table.
    - Add **Hostname** and **Hostname + Id** reporting and labeling functionality to Vitals components.
    - Add **Total Requests per Consumer** chart to individual consumer pages.
    - Add **Total Requests** and **Upstream Latency** charts to the Vitals page.
    - Add information dialogs for vital charts next to chart titles.
    - Introduced **Total Requests** chart on Dashboard.
    - Automatically saves chart preferences and restores on reload.

  - **OpenID Connect plugins**
    - Support passing dynamic arguments to authorization endpoint from client
    - Support logout with optional revocation and RP-initiated logout

  - Features inherited from [Kong Community Edition 0.12.0](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#added) - includes:
    - Health checks
    - Hash-based load balancing
    - Logging plugins track unauthorized and rate-limited requests
    - And more...

### Fixes
- **Proxy Cache**
  - Better handling of input configuration data types. In some cases configuration sent from the GUI would case requests to be bypassed when they should have been cached.

- **OAuth2 Introspection**
  - Improved error handling in TCP/HTTP connections to the introspection server.

- **Vitals**
  - Aggregating minutes at the same time as seconds are being written.
  - Returning more than one minute's worth of seconds data.

- **Admin GUI**
  - Input type for Certificates is now a text area box.
  - Infer types based on default values and object type from the API Schema for Plugins.

- Fixes inherited from Kong Community Edition 0.12.0.
