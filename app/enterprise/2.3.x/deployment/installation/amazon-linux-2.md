title: Install Kong Enterprise on Amazon Linux 2
---

## Introduction

This guide walks through downloading, installing, and starting **Kong Enterprise** on **Amazon Linux 2**.

The configuration shown in this guide is intended as an example. Depending on your
environment, you may need to make modifications and take measures to properly conclude
the installation and configuration.

Kong supports both PostgreSQL 9.5+ and Cassandra 3.11.* as its datastore. This guide provides
steps to configure PostgreSQL. For assistance in setting up Cassandra, please contact your Sales or Support representative.

### Deployment Options

The following instructions assume that you are deploying {{site.ee_product_name}} in [classic embedded mode](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/deployment/deployment-options).

If you want to run {{site.ee_product_name}} in Hybrid mode, the instructions in this topic will walk you though setting up a Control Plane instance. Afterward, you will need to bring up additional Kong instances for the Data Planes, and perform further configuration steps. See [Hybrid Mode Setup](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/deployment/hybrid-mode-setup) for details.

## Prerequisites

To complete this installation you will need:

{% include /md/{{page.kong_version}}/bintray-and-license.md %}
* A supported Amazon Linux 2 system with root-equivalent access.

## Step 1. Prepare to Install Kong Enterprise and Download the License File

There are two options to install Kong Enterprise on Amazon Linux 2. Both require a login to Bintray.

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Download RPM File %}

1. Log in to [Bintray](http://bintray.com) using your Kong credentials. See [prerequisites](#prerequisites)
for information on how to get access.
2. Go to: [https://bintray.com/kong/kong-enterprise-edition-aws](https://bintray.com/kong/kong-enterprise-edition-aws).
3. Select the `aws` folder. Kong Enterprise versions are listed in reverse chronological order.
4. Select the latest Kong version from the list.
5. From the Kong version detail page, click the **Files** tab, then click the distribution folder.
6. Save the available RPM file. For example: `kong-enterprise-edition-{{page.kong_latest.version}}.aws.rpm`.
7. Copy the RPM file to your home directory on the Amazon Linux 2 system. You can use a command like:

    ```bash
    $ scp kong-enterprise-edition-{{page.kong_latest.version}}.aws.rpm <amazon user>@<server>:~
    ```

### (Optional) Verify the Package Integrity

1. Download Kong's official public key to ensure the integrity of the RPM package:

    ```bash
    $ curl -o kong.key https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=kong
    $ sudo rpm --import kong.key
    $ sudo rpm -K kong-enterprise-edition-{{page.kong_latest.version}}.aws.rpm
    ```

2. Verify you get an OK check. Output should be similar to this:

    ```
    kong-enterprise-edition-{{page.kong_latest.version}}.el7.noarch.rpm: sha1 md5 OK
    ```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Download Kong repo file and add to Yum repo %}

1. Log in to [Bintray](http://bintray.com) using your Kong credentials. See [prerequisites](#prerequisites)
for information on how to get access.

2. Download the Kong Enterprise RPM repo file from:

    [https://bintray.com/kong/kong-enterprise-edition-aws/rpm](https://bintray.com/kong/kong-enterprise-edition-aws/rpm).

3. Edit the repo file using your preferred editor and alter the `baseurl` line with your information as follows:

    ```
    baseurl=https://USERNAME:API_KEY@kong.bintray.com/kong-enterprise-edition-aws
    ```

    * Replace `USERNAME` with your Bintray account username.
    * Replace `API_KEY` with your Bintray API key. To find the key, go to [https://bintray.com/profile/edit](https://bintray.com/profile/edit) and select **API Key**.

    The result should look something like this:

    ```
    baseurl=https://john-company:12234e314356291a2b11058591bba195830@kong.bintray.com/kong-enterprise-edition-aws
    ```

4. Securely copy the changed repo file to your home directory on the Amazon
Linux 2 system. For example:

    ```bash
    $ scp bintray--kong-kong-enterprise-edition-aws.repo <amazon user>@<server>:~
    ```

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

### Download your Kong Enterprise License

1. Download your license file from your account files in Bintray:

    ```
    https://bintray.com/kong/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>/license#files`
    ```

2. Securely copy the license file to your home directory on the Amazon Linux
system. For example:

    ```bash
    $ scp license.json <amazon username>@<server>:~
    ```

### Result

You should now have two files in your home directory on the target Amazon system:

- Either the Kong RPM or Kong Yum repo file.
- The license file `license.json`

## Step 2. Install Kong Enterprise

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Using a downloaded RPM package %}

Execute a command similar to the following, using the appropriate RPM file name you downloaded.

```bash
$ sudo yum install /path/to/package.rpm --nogpgcheck
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Using Yum repo %}

1. Move the repo file in your home directory to the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory.

    ```bash
    $ sudo mv bintray--kong-kong-enterprise-edition-aws.repo /etc/yum.repos.d/
    ```

2. Run the installation using the Yum repository:

    ```bash
    $ sudo yum update -y
    $ sudo yum install kong-enterprise-edition -y
    ```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

### Copy the License File

Copy the license file from your home directory to the `/etc/kong` directory:

```bash
$ sudo cp license.json /etc/kong/license.json
```

## Step 3. Set up PostgreSQL

1. Install PostgreSQL.

    Follow the instructions available at [https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) to install a supported version of PostgreSQL. Kong supports version 9.5 and higher. As an example, you can run a command set similar to:

    ```bash
    $ sudo amazon-linux-extras install postgresql9.6
    $ sudo yum install postgresql postgresql-server
    ```

2. Initialize the PostgreSQL database and enable automatic start:

    ```bash
    $ sudo /usr/bin/postgresql-setup --initdb
    $ sudo systemctl enable postgresql.service
    $ sudo systemctl start postgresql
    ```  
    > ⚠️**Note**: If you're using Postgresql 10+, make sure you change the `password_encryption` parameter from `scram-sha-256` to `md5` in your  `postgresql.conf` file before proceeding. The file `postgresql.conf` is commonly found in this location: `/var/lib/pgsql/<version>/data/postgresql.conf`.

3. Switch to PostgreSQL user and launch PostgreSQL:

    ```bash
    $ sudo -i -u postgres
    $ psql
    ```

4. Create a Kong database with a username and password:

    ```bash
    $ psql> CREATE USER kong; CREATE DATABASE kong OWNER kong; ALTER USER kong WITH password 'kong';
    ```
> ⚠️**Note**: Make sure the username and password for the Kong Database are
> kept safe. This example uses a simple username and password for illustration purposes only. Note the database name, username and password for later.

5. Exit from PostgreSQL and return to your terminal account.

    ```bash
    $ psql> \q
    $ exit
    ```

6. Edit the the PostgreSQL configuration file `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf` using your preferred editor.

    Under IPv4 local connections replace `ident` with `md5`:

    | Protocol   	| Type 	| Database 	| User 	| Address      	| Method 	|
    |------------	|------	|----------	|------	|--------------	|--------	|
    | IPv4 local 	| host 	| all      	| all  	| 127.0.0.1/32 	| md5    	|
    | IPv6 local 	| host 	| all      	| all  	| 1/128        	| ident  	|

    Older versions of PostgreSQL use `ident` authentication by default, newer versions (PSQL 10+) use `scram-sha-256`. To allow the `kong` user to communicate with the database locally, change the authentication method to `md5` by modifying the PostgreSQL configuration file.

7. Restart PostgreSQL.

    ```bash
    $ sudo systemctl restart postgresql
    ```

## Step 4. Modify Kong's configuration file to work with PostgreSQL

1. Make a copy of Kong's default configuration file.

    ```bash
    $ sudo cp /etc/kong/kong.conf.default /etc/kong/kong.conf
    ```

2. Uncomment and update the PostgreSQL database properties in `/etc/kong/kong.conf` using your preferred text editor. Replace `pg_user`, `pg_password` and `pg_database` with the correct values.

    ```
    pg_user = kong
    pg_password = kong
    pg_database = kong
    ```
  > Note: If you used different values for the user and database name, use those values for the user and database name.

## Step 5. Seed the Super Admin password and bootstrap Kong

{% include /md/{{page.kong_version}}/ee-kong-user.md %}

Setting a password for the **Super Admin** before initial start-up is strongly recommended. This will permit the use of RBAC (Role Based Access Control) at a later time, if needed.

1. Create an environment variable with the desired **Super Admin** password and store the password in a safe place. Run migrations to prepare the Kong database:

    ```bash
    $ sudo KONG_PASSWORD=<password-only-you-know> /usr/local/bin/kong migrations bootstrap -c /etc/kong/kong.conf
    ```

3. Start Kong Enterprise:

    ```bash
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/kong start -c /etc/kong/kong.conf
    ```

4. Verify Kong Enterprise is working:
  ```bash
  $ curl -i -X GET --url http://localhost:8001/services
  ```
5. You should receive a `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` message.

## Step 6. Finalize Configuration and Verify Installation

### Enable and Configure Kong Manager

1. To access Kong Enterprise's Graphical User Interface, Kong Manager, update the `admin_gui_url` property in `/etc/kong/kong.conf` file to the DNS, or IP address, of the Amazon Linux system. For example:

    ```
    admin_gui_url = http://<DNSorIP>:8002
    ```

    This setting needs to resolve to a network path that will reach the Amazon Linux host.

2. It is necessary to update the administration API setting to listen on the needed network interfaces on the Amazon Linux host. A setting of `0.0.0.0:8001` will listen on port `8001` on all available network interfaces.

    ```
    admin_listen = 0.0.0.0:8001, 0.0.0.0:8444 ssl
    ```

3. You may also list network interfaces separately as in this example:

    ```
    admin_listen = 0.0.0.0:8001, 0.0.0.0:8444 ssl, 127.0.0.1:8001, 127.0.0.1:8444 ssl
    ```

4. Restart Kong for the setting to take effect:

    ```bash
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/kong restart
    ```

5. You may now access Kong Manager on port `8002`.

### Enable the Kong Developer Portal

1. Kong Enterprise's Developer Portal can be enabled by setting the `portal` property to `on` and setting the `portal_gui_host` property to the DNS, or IP address, of the Amazon Linux system. For example:

    ```
    portal = on
    portal_gui_host = <DNSorIP>:8003
    ```

2. Restart Kong for the setting to take effect:

    ```bash
    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/kong restart
    ```

3. The final step is to enable the Developer Portal. To do this, execute the following command, updating `DNSorIP` to reflect the IP or valid DNS for the Amazon Linux system.

    ```bash
    $ curl -X PATCH http://<DNSorIP>:8001/workspaces/default   --data "config.portal=true"
    ```

4. You can now access the Developer Portal on the default workspace with a URL like:

    ```
    http://<DNSorIP>:8003/default
    ```
