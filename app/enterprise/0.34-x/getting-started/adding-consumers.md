title: Adding Consumers
---

## Introduction

In the last section, we learned how to add plugins to Kong Enterprise. 
In this section, we're going to learn how to add [Consumers][consumers] to 
Kong. Consumers are associated to individuals or applications using your 
API. As an entity, they can be used for tracking, access management, and more.

**Note:** This section assumes you have [enabled][enabling-plugins] the
[Basic Authentication][basic-auth] plugin. If you haven't, you can either
[enable the plugin][enabling-plugins] or skip steps two and three.

## 1. Create a Consumer

If you'd like to use the Admin API, issue the following cURL request to
create your first Consumer, named `Aladdin`:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST \
  --url http://localhost:8001/consumers/ \
  --data "username=Aladdin"
```

You should see a response similar to the one below:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "username": "Aladdin",
  "created_at": 1428555626000,
  "id": "bbdf1c48-19dc-4ab7-cae0-ff4f59d87dc9"
}
```
Or, add your first Consumer via Kong Manager:

  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

Congratulations! You've just added your first Consumer to Kong.

**Note:** Kong also accepts a `custom_id` parameter when
[creating Consumers][API-consumers] to associate a Consumer with your existing 
user database.

## 2. Provision Credentials for Your Consumer

Now, we can create credentials for our recently created Consumer `Aladdin` by
issuing the following request:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST \
  --url http://localhost:8001/consumers/Aladdin/basic-auth/ \
  --data "username=Aladdin" \
  --data "password=OpenSesame"
```

## 3. Verify Validity of Consumer Credentials 

The authorization header must be base64 encoded. For example, if the credential 
uses Aladdin as the username and OpenSesame as the password, then the fieldâ€™s 
value is the base64-encoding of Aladdin:OpenSesame, or QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l.

Then the Authorization (or Proxy-Authorization) header must appear as:

```
Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l
```

To verify our new Consumer has access, make a request with the header:

```bash
$ curl http://kong:8000/{path matching a configured Route} \
    -H 'Authorization: Basic QWxhZGRpbjpPcGVuU2VzYW1l'
```
