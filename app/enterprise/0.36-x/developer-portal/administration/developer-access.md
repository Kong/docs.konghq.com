## How to Manage Your Developer Credentials

As a Developer, once you are [approved](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/developer-portal/management/developers/#developer-status), you can login to the Dev Portal Dashboard and [create](#creating-a-credential), [update](#updating-a-credential), or [delete](#deleting-a-credential) credentials. The credential options available will be based on which authentication plugins the Kong admin has enabled.

Current plugins supported:

- [ACL](/plugins/acl/)
- [Basic Authentication](/plugins/basic-authentication/)
- [Key Authentication](/plugins/key-authentication/)
- [OAuth 2.0](/hub/kong-inc/oauth2/)
- [HMAC Signature Authentication](/plugins/hmac-authentication/)
- [JWT](/plugins/jwt/)

> Note: This refers to Developer API credentials, not authentication for access to the Dev Portal. Learn more about which authentication plugins are supported by the Dev Portal on the [Authentication](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/developer-portal/configuration/authentication) page.

## Dev Portal Account Management

To update your Dev Portal account's email, username, password, or to delete your account, login into the Dev Portal and select "Settings" from the user drop down menu. 

Deleting your account will immediately revoke access to the Dev Portal and will delete any API credentials associated with your account.
