## Approving Developers

Developers who have requested access to a Dev Portal will appear under the 
**Requested Access** tab. From this tab you can choose to *Accept* or *Reject* 
the developer from the actions in the table row. After selecting an action the 
corresponding tab will update.


## Viewing Approved Developers

To view all currently approved developers choose the **Approved** tab. From here you can choose to *Revoke* or *Delete* a particular developer. Additionally you can use this view to send an email to a developer with the **Email Developer** `mailto` link. See [Emailing Developers](#emailing-developers) for more info.


## Viewing Revoked Developers

To view all currently revoked developers choose the **Revoked** tab. From here you can choose to *Re-approve* or *Delete* a developer.


## Viewing Rejected Developers

To view all currently rejected developers choose the **Rejected** tab. Rejected developers completed the registration flow on your Dev Portal but were rejected from the **Request Access** tab. You may *Approve* or *Delete* a developer from this tab.


## Emailing Developers

### Inviting Developers to Register

To invite a single or set of developers...

1. Click the **Invite Developers** button from the top right corner above the tabs
2. Use the popup modal to enter email addresses separated by commas
3. After all emails have been added click **Invite**. This will open a pre-filled message in your default email client with a link to the registration page for your Dev Portal

Each developer is bcc'd by default for privacy. You may choose to edit the message or send as is.
