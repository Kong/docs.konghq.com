## kong.service

The service module contains a set of functions to manipulate the connection
 aspect of the request to the Service, such as connecting to a given host, IP
 address/port, or choosing a given Upstream entity for load-balancing and
 healthchecking.



### kong.service.set_upstream(host)

Sets the desired Upstream entity to handle the load-balancing step for
 this request.  Using this method is equivalent to creating a Service with a
 `host` property equal to that of an Upstream entity (in which case, the
 request would be proxied to one of the Targets associated with that
 Upstream).

 The `host` argument should receive a string equal to that of one of the
 Upstream entities currently configured.


**Phases**

* access

**Parameters**

* **host** (string):

**Returns**

1.  `boolean|nil` `true` on success, or `nil` if no upstream entities
 where found

1.  `string|nil`  An error message describing the error if there was
 one.



**Usage**

``` lua
local ok, err = kong.service.set_upstream("service.prod")
if not ok then
  kong.log.err(err)
  return
end
```

### kong.service.set_target(host, port)

Sets the host and port on which to connect to for proxying the request.  ]]
 Using this method is equivalent to ask Kong to not run the load-balancing
 phase for this request, and consider it manually overridden.
 Load-balancing components such as retries and health-checks will also be
 ignored for this request.

 The `host` argument expects a string containing the IP address of the
 upstream server (IPv4/IPv6), and the `port` argument must contain a number
 representing the port on which to connect to.


**Phases**

* access

**Parameters**

* **host** (string):
* **port** (number):

**Usage**

``` lua
kong.service.set_target("service.local", 443)
kong.service.set_target("192.168.130.1", 80)
```
