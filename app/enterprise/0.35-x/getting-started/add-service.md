title: How to Add a Service and Route
---

## 1. Add Your Service Using the Admin API or Kong Manager

If you'd like to use the Admin API, issue the following cURL request to add
your first Service (Mockbin) to Kong Enterprise:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST \
  --url http://localhost:8001/apis/ \
  --data 'name=example-api' \
  --data 'hosts=example.com' \
  --data 'upstream_url=http://mockbin.org'
```

Alternatively, add your first Service in Kong Manager via Services & Routes:

## 2. Verify Your Service Has Been Added

You'll get a confirmation message in Kong Manager, or if you used cURL
you should see a response similar to the following:

```http
HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Content-Type: application/json
Connection: keep-alive

{
  "created_at": 1488830759000,
  "hosts": [
      "example.com"
  ],
  "http_if_terminated": false,
  "https_only": false,
  "id": "6378122c-a0a1-438d-a5c6-efabae9fb969",
  "name": "example-api",
  "preserve_host": false,
  "retries": 5,
  "strip_uri": true,
  "upstream_connect_timeout": 60000,
  "upstream_read_timeout": 60000,
  "upstream_send_timeout": 60000,
  "upstream_url": "http://mockbin.org"
}
```

Kong is now aware of your Service and ready to proxy requests.

## 3. Forward Requests through Kong Enterprise

Issue the following cURL request to verify that Kong is properly forwarding
requests to your Service. Note that by default, Kong handles proxy
requests on port `:8000`:

```bash
$ curl -i -X GET \
  --url http://localhost:8000/ \
  --header 'Host: example.com'
```

A successful response means Kong is now forwarding requests made to
`http://localhost:8000` to the `upstream_url` we configured in step #1,
and is forwarding the response back to us. Kong knows to do this through
the header defined in the above cURL request `Host: example.com`
