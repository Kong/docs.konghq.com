### Introduction

Although an organization's teams share the same Kong cluster, 
it is possible to divide the cluster into logical groups with 
limited access. These **Workspaces** provide clearer 
segmentation of traffic and entities. Each team's 
access may be restricted to their own **Workspace**, supporting 
the principle of least privilege. 

The guide below describes how to create **Workspaces** in Kong 
Manager. As an alternative, if a **Super Admin** wants to create 
a **Workspace** with the Admin API, it is possible to do so 
using the [`/workspaces/` route](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api/workspaces/reference/#add-workspace).

### Prerequisites

* [`enforce_rbac = on`](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/property-reference/#enforce_rbac)
* Kong Enterprise has [started](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/getting-started/start-kong)
* Logged in to Kong Manager as a **Super Admin**

## Step 1

On the **Workspaces** page, click the **New Workspace** 
button at the top right to open the **Create Workspace** form.

## Step 2

Name the new **Workspace**.

⚠️ **WARNING**: Each **Workspace** name should be unique, 
regardless of letter case. For example, naming one 
**Workspace** "Payments" and another one "payments" will 
create two different workspaces that appear identical.

⚠️ **WARNING**: Do not name Workspaces the same as these major 
routes in Kong Manager:

* Admins
* APIs
* Certificates
* Consumers
* Plugins
* Portal
* Routes
* Services
* SNIs
* Upstreams
* Vitals

## Step 3

Select a color or avatar to make each **Workspace** easier 
to distinguish, or accept the default color.

## Step 4

Click the **Create New Workspace** button.

Upon creation, the **Workspace**'s **Dashboard** page will 
appear.

## Step 5

On the left sidebar, click the **Admins** link in the 
**Security** section. (If the sidebar is collapsed, hover over 
the **security badge icon** at the bottom and click the 
**Admins** link.)

### Next Steps

The **Admins** page displays a list of current **Admins** and 
**Roles**. Four default **Roles** specific to the new 
**Workspace** are already visible, and new **Roles** specific 
to the **Workspace** can be assigned from this page.
