plugin_body: |
    Attributes | Description
    ---:| ---
    `name` |  The name of the Plugin that's going to be added. Currently the Plugin must be installed in every Kong instance separately. 
    `route`<br>*optional* |  If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via the specified route. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Route being used.  Defaults to `null`. With form-encoded, the notation is `route.id=<route_id>`. With JSON, use `"route":{"id":"<route_id>"}`.
    `service`<br>*optional* |  If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via one of the routes belonging to the specified Service. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Service being matched.  Defaults to `null`. With form-encoded, the notation is `service.id=<service_id>`. With JSON, use `"service":{"id":"<service_id>"}`.
    `consumer`<br>*optional* |  If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers this way.). Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated consumer.  Defaults to `null`. With form-encoded, the notation is `consumer.id=<consumer_id>`. With JSON, use `"consumer":{"id":"<consumer_id>"}`.
    `config`<br>*optional* |  The configuration properties for the Plugin which can be found on the plugins documentation page in the [Kong Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/). 
    `run_on` |  Control on which Kong nodes this plugin will run, given a Service Mesh scenario. Accepted values are: * `first`, meaning "run on the first Kong node that is encountered by the request". On an API Getaway scenario, this is the usual operation, since there is only one Kong node in between source and destination. In a sidecar-to-sidecar Service Mesh scenario, this means running the plugin only on the Kong sidecar of the outbound connection. * `second`, meaning "run on the second node that is encountered by the request". This option is only relevant for sidecar-to-sidecar Service Mesh scenarios: this means running the plugin only on the Kong sidecar of the inbound connection. * `all` means "run on all nodes", meaning both sidecars in a sidecar-to-sidecar scenario. This is useful for tracing/logging plugins.  Defaults to `"first"`.
    `enabled`<br>*optional* | Whether the plugin is applied. Defaults to `true`.

Kong comes with an **internal** RESTful Admin API for administration purposes.
Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will
keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

- `8001` is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
- `8444` is the default port for HTTPS traffic to the Admin API.

This API is designed for internal use and provides full control over Kong, so
care should be taken when setting up Kong environments to avoid undue public
exposure of this API. See [this document][secure-admin-api] for a discussion
of methods to secure the Admin API.

## Supported Content Types

The Admin API accepts 2 content types on every endpoint:

- **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**

Simple enough for basic request bodies, you will probably use it most of the time.
Note that when sending nested values, Kong expects nested objects to be referenced
with dotted keys. Example:

```
config.limit=10&config.period=seconds
```

Arrays and sets can be specified in various ways:

1. Sending same parameter multiple times:

```
hosts=example.com&hosts=example.org
```

2. Using array notation:

```
hosts[1]=example.com&hosts[2]=example.org
```
or 
```
hosts[]=example.com&hosts[]=example.org
```

Array and object notation can also be mixed:

```
config.hosts[1]=example.com&config.hosts[2]=example.org
```


- **application/json**

Handy for complex bodies (ex: complex plugin configuration), in that case simply send
a JSON representation of the data you want to send. Example:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "limit": 10,
        "period": "seconds"
    }
}
```

JSON arrays can be specified as well:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "limit": 10,
        "period": "seconds",
        "hosts": [ "example.com", "example.org" ]
    }
}
```

## Information routes



### Retrieve node information

Retrieve generic details about a node.

<div class="endpoint get">/</div>

*Response*

```
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "hostname": "",
    "node_id": "6a72192c-a3a1-4c8d-95c6-efabae9fb969",
    "lua_version": "LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3",
    "plugins": {
        "available_on_server": [
            ...
        ],
        "enabled_in_cluster": [
            ...
        ]
    },
    "configuration" : {
        ...
    },
    "tagline": "Welcome to Kong",
    "version": "0.14.0"
}
```

* `node_id`: A UUID representing the running Kong node. This UUID
  is randomly generated when Kong starts, so the node will have a
  different `node_id` each time it is restarted.
* `available_on_server`: Names of plugins that are installed on the node.
* `enabled_in_cluster`: Names of plugins that are enabled/configured.
  That is, the plugins configurations currently in the datastore shared
  by all Kong nodes.


---

### Retrieve node status

Retrieve usage information about a node, with some basic information
about the connections being processed by the underlying nginx process,
and the status of the database connection.

If you want to monitor the Kong process, since Kong is built on top
of nginx, every existing nginx monitoring tool or agent can be used.


<div class="endpoint get">/status</div>

*Response*

```
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "server": {
        "total_requests": 3,
        "connections_active": 1,
        "connections_accepted": 1,
        "connections_handled": 1,
        "connections_reading": 0,
        "connections_writing": 1,
        "connections_waiting": 0
    },
    "database": {
        "reachable": true
    }
}
```

* `server`: Metrics about the nginx HTTP/S server.
    * `total_requests`: The total number of client requests.
    * `connections_active`: The current number of active client
      connections including Waiting connections.
    * `connections_accepted`: The total number of accepted client
      connections.
    * `connections_handled`: The total number of handled connections.
      Generally, the parameter value is the same as accepts unless
      some resource limits have been reached.
    * `connections_reading`: The current number of connections
      where Kong is reading the request header.
    * `connections_writing`: The current number of connections
      where nginx is writing the response back to the client.
    * `connections_waiting`: The current number of idle client
      connections waiting for a request.
* `database`: Metrics about the database.
    * `reachable`: A boolean value reflecting the state of the
      database connection. Please note that this flag **does not**
      reflect the health of the database itself.

## Service Object

Service entities, as the name implies, are abstractions of each of your own
upstream services. Examples of Services would be a data transformation
microservice, a billing API, etc.

The main attribute of a Service is its URL (where Kong should proxy traffic
to), which can be set as a single string or by specifying its `protocol`,
`host`, `port` and `path` individually.

Services are associated to Routes (a Service can have many Routes associated
with it). Routes are entry-points in Kong and define rules to match client
requests. Once a Route is matched, Kong proxies the request to its associated
Service. See the [Proxy Reference][proxy-reference] for a detailed explanation
of how Kong proxies traffic.


```json
{{ page.service_json }}
```

## Route Object

Route entities define rules to match client requests. Each Route is
associated with a Service, and a Service may have multiple Routes associated to
it. Every request matching a given Route will be proxied to its associated
Service.

The combination of Routes and Services (and the separation of concerns between
them) offers a powerful routing mechanism with which it is possible to define
fine-grained entry-points in Kong leading to different upstream services of
your infrastructure.

## Plugin Object

A Plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed during
the HTTP request/response lifecycle. It is how you can add functionalities
to Services that run behind Kong, like Authentication or Rate Limiting for
example. You can find more information about how to install and what values
each plugin takes by visiting the [Kong Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/).

When adding a Plugin Configuration to a Service, every request made by a client to
that Service will run said Plugin. If a Plugin needs to be tuned to different
values for some specific Consumers, you can do so by specifying the
`consumer_id` value:


```json
{{ page.plugin_json }}
```

See the [Precedence](#precedence) section below for more details.

#### Precedence

A plugin will always be run once and only once per request. But the
configuration with which it will run depends on the entities it has been
configured for.

Plugins can be configured for various entities, combination of entities, or
even globally. This is useful, for example, when you wish to configure a plugin
a certain way for most requests, but make _authenticated requests_ behave
slightly differently.

Therefore, there exists an order of precedence for running a plugin when it has
been applied to different entities with different configurations. The rule of
thumb is: the more specific a plugin is with regards to how many entities it
has been configured on, the higher its priority.

The complete order of precedence when a plugin has been configured multiple
times is:

1. Plugins configured on a combination of: a Route, a Service, and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
2. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
3. Plugins configured on a combination of a Service and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
4. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Service.
5. Plugins configured on a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
6. Plugins configured on a Route.
7. Plugins configured on a Service.
8. Plugins configured to run globally.

**Example**: if the `rate-limiting` plugin is applied twice (with different
configurations): for a Service (Plugin config A), and for a Consumer (Plugin
config B), then requests authenticating this Consumer will run Plugin config B
and ignore A. However, requests that do not authenticate this Consumer will
fallback to running Plugin config A. Note that if config B is disabled
(its `enabled` flag is set to `false`), config A will apply to requests that
would have otherwise matched config B.

## Upstream Object

The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to loadbalance
incoming requests over multiple services (targets). So for example an upstream
named `service.v1.xyz` for a Service object whose `host` is `service.v1.xyz`.
Requests for this Service would be proxied to the targets defined within the upstream.

An upstream also includes a [health checker][healthchecks], which is able to
enable and disable targets based on their ability or inability to serve
requests. The configuration for the health checker is stored in the upstream
object, and applies to all of its targets.

### Show Upstream health for node

Displays the health status for all Targets of a given Upstream, according to
the perspective of a specific Kong node. Note that, being node-specific
information, making this same request to different nodes of the Kong cluster
may produce different results. For example, one specific node of the Kong
cluster may be experiencing network issues, causing it to fail to connect to
some Targets: these Targets will be marked as unhealthy by that node
(directing traffic from this node to other Targets that it can successfully
reach), but healthy to all others Kong nodes (which have no problems using that
Target).

The `data` field of the response contains an array of Target objects.
The health for each Target is returned in its `health` field:

* If a Target fails to be activated in the ring balancer due to DNS issues,
  its status displays as `DNS_ERROR`.
* When [health checks][healthchecks] are not enabled in the Upstream
  configuration, the health status for active Targets is displayed as
  `HEALTHCHECKS_OFF`.
* When health checks are enabled and the Target is determined to be healthy,
  either automatically or [manually](#set-target-as-healthy),
  its status is displayed as `HEALTHY`. This means that this Target is
  currently included in this Upstream's load balancer ring.
* When a Target has been disabled by either active or passive health checks
  (circuit breakers) or [manually](#set-target-as-unhealthy),
  its status is displayed as `UNHEALTHY`. The load balancer is not directing
  any traffic to this Target via this Upstream.


<div class="endpoint get">/upstreams/{name or id}/health/</div>

## Target Object

A target is an ip address/hostname with a port that identifies an instance of a backend
service. Every upstream can have many targets, and the targets can be
dynamically added. Changes are effectuated on the fly.

Because the upstream maintains a history of target changes, the targets cannot
be deleted or modified. To disable a target, post a new one with `weight=0`;
alternatively, use the `DELETE` convenience method to accomplish the same.

The current target object definition is the one with the latest `created_at`.


```json
{{ page.target_json }}
```

### Set target as healthy

Set the current health status of a target in the load balancer to "healthy"

This endpoint can be used to manually re-enable a target that was previously
disabled by the upstream's [health checker][healthchecks]. Upstreams only
forward requests to healthy nodes, so this call tells Kong to start using this
target again.

This resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all workers
of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the "healthy"
status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.


<div class="endpoint post">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{target or id}/healthy</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream.
`target or id`<br>**required** | The host/port combination element of the target to set as healthy, or the `id` of an existing target entry.


*Response*

```
HTTP 204 No Content
```

### Set target as unhealthy

Set the current health status of a target in the load balancer to "unhealthy"
in the entire Kong cluster.

This endpoint can be used to manually disable a target and have it stop
responding to requests. Upstreams only forward requests to healthy nodes, so
this call tells Kong to start skipping this target in the ring-balancer
algorithm.

This call resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all
workers of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the
"unhealthy" status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.

[Active health checks][active] continue to execute for unhealthy
targets. Note that if active health checks are enabled and the probe detects
that the target is actually healthy, it will automatically re-enable it again.
To permanently remove a target from the ring-balancer, you should [delete a
target](#delete-target) instead.


<div class="endpoint post">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{target or id}/unhealthy</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream.
`target or id`<br>**required** | The host/port combination element of the target to set as unhealthy, or the `id` of an existing target entry.


*Response*

```
HTTP 204 No Content
```

### List all Targets

Lists all targets of the upstream. Multiple target objects for the same
target may be returned, showing the history of changes for a specific target.
The target object with the latest `created_at` is the current definition.


<div class="endpoint get">/upstreams/{name or id}/targets/all/</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream for which to list the targets.


*Response*

```
HTTP 200 OK
```
