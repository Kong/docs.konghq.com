button at the top right to see the **Create Workspace** form.

2. Name the new Workspace.

    ⚠️ **WARNING**: Each Workspace name should be unique, regardless of letter 
    case. For example, naming one Workspace "Payments" and another one 
    "payments" will create two different workspaces that look identical.

    ⚠️ **WARNING**: Do not name Workspaces the same as these major routes in Kong 
    Manager:

    ```
    • Admins
    • APIs
    • Certificates
    • Consumers
    • Plugins
    • Portal
    • Routes
    • Services
    • SNIs
    • Upstreams
    • Vitals
    ```

3. Select a color or avatar to make each **Workspace** easier to distinguish, or 
accept the default color.

4. Click the "Create New Workspace" button. Upon creation, the application will 
navigate to the new Workspace's "Dashboard" page.

5. On the left sidebar, click the "Admins" link in the "Security" section. If 
the sidebar is collapsed, hover over the security badge icon at the bottom and 
click the "Admins" link.

6. The "Admins" page displays a list of current Admins and Roles. Four default 
Roles specific to the new Workspace are already visible, and new Roles specific 
to the Workspace can be assigned from this page.
