## How does the Sessions Plugin work in Kong Manager?

When a user logs in to Kong Manager with their credentials, the Sessions Plugin 
will create a session cookie. The cookie is used for all subsequent requests and 
is valid to authenticate the user. The session has a limited duration and renews 
at a configurable interval, which helps prevent an attacker from obtaining and
 using a stale cookie after the session has ended. 

The Session configuration is secure by default, which may 
[require alteration](#session-security) if using HTTP or different domains for 
the Admin API and Kong Manager. Even if an attacker were to obtain a stale 
cookie, it would not benefit them since the cookie is encrypted. The encrypted 
session data may be stored either in Kong or the cookie itself. 

## Configuration to Use the Sessions Plugin with Kong Manager

To enable sessions authentication, configure the following:

```
enforce_rbac = on
admin_gui_auth = <set to desired auth type>
admin_gui_session_conf = {
    "secret":"<SET_SECRET>", 
    "cookie_name":"<SET_COOKIE_NAME>", 
    "storage":"<SET_STORAGE>", 
    "cookie_lifetime":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_TO_LIVE>, 
    "cookie_renew":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_LEFT_TO_RENEW>
    "cookie_secure":<SET_DEPENDING_ON_PROTOCOL>
    "cookie_samesite":"<SET_DEPENDING_ON_DOMAIN>"
}
```

* `"cookie_name":"<SET_COOKIE_NAME>"`: The name of the cookie
  * For example, `"cookie_name":"kong_cookie"`
* `"secret":"<SET_SECRET>"`: The secret used in keyed HMAC generation. Although 
  the **Session Plugin's** default is a random string, the `secret` _must_ be 
  manually set for use with Kong Manager since it must be the same across all 
  Kong workers/nodes.
* `"storage":"<SET_STORAGE>"`: Where session data is stored. It is `"cookie"` by default, but may be more secure if set to `"kong"` since access to the database would be required.
* `"cookie_lifetime":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_TO_LIVE>`: The duration (in seconds) that the session will remain open; 3600 by    default.
* `"cookie_renew":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_LEFT_TO_RENEW>`: The duration (in seconds) of a session remaining at which point 
   the Plugin renews the session; 600 by default.
* `"cookie_secure":<SET_DEPENDING_ON_PROTOCOL>`: `true` by default. See [Session Security](#session-security) for 
    exceptions.
* `"cookie_samesite":"<SET_DEPENDING_ON_DOMAIN>"`: `"Strict"` by default. See [Session Security](#session-security) for 
    exceptions.

⚠️**Important:**
*The following properties must not be altered from default for use with Kong Manager:*
* `logout_methods`
* `logout_query_arg`
* `logout_post_arg`

For detailed descriptions of each configuration property, learn more in the 
[Session Plugin documentation](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/plugins/session). 

## Session Security

The Session configuration is secure by default, so the cookie uses the 
[Secure, HttpOnly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies), 
and [SameSite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#SameSite_cookies) 
directives. 

⚠️**Important:** The following properties must be altered depending on the protocol and domains in use:
* If using HTTP instead of HTTPS: `"cookie_secure": false`
* If using different domains for the Admin API and Kong Manager: `"cookie_samesite": "off"`

## Example Configurations

If using HTTPS and hosting Kong Manager and the Admin API from the same domain, 
the following configuration could be used for Basic Auth:

```
enforce_rbac = on
admin_gui_auth = basic-auth
admin_gui_session_conf = {
    "cookie_name":"$4m04$"
    "secret":"change-this-secret"
    "storage":"kong"
}
```

In testing, if using HTTP, the following configuration could be used instead:

```
enforce_rbac = on
admin_gui_auth = basic-auth
admin_gui_session_conf = {
    "cookie_name":"04tm34l"
    "secret":"change-this-secret"
    "storage":"kong"
    "cookie_secure":false
}
```
