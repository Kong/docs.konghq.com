title: Hybrid Mode Overview
---

## Introduction
Traditionally, Kong has always required a database, which could be either
Postgres or Cassandra, to store configured entities such as Routes, Services,
and Plugins.

Starting with {{site.ee_product_name}} 2.1, Kong can be deployed in
Hybrid mode, also known as Control Plane / Data Plane Separation (CP/DP).

In this mode, Kong nodes in a cluster are split into two roles: Control Plane
(CP), where configuration is managed and the Admin API is served from; and Data
Plane (DP), which serves traffic for the proxy. Each DP node is connected to one
of the CP nodes. Instead of accessing the database contents directly in the
traditional deployment method, the DP nodes maintain connection with CP nodes,
and receive the latest configuration.

## Benefits

Hybrid mode deployments have the following benefits:

* **Deployment flexibility:** Users can deploy groups of Data Planes in
different data centers, geographies, or zones without needing a local clustered
database for each DP group.
* **Increased reliability:** The availability of the database does not affect
the availability of the Data Planes. Each DP caches the latest configuration it
received from the Control Plane on local disk storage, so if CP nodes are down,
the DP nodes keep functioning.  
    * While the CP is down, DP nodes constantly try to reestablish communication.
    * DP nodes can be restarted while the CP is down, and still proxy traffic
    normally.
* **Traffic reduction:** Drastically reduces the amount of traffic to and from
the database, since only CP nodes need a direct connection to the database.
* **Increased security:** If one of the DP nodes is compromised, an attacker
wonâ€™t be able to affect other nodes in the Kong cluster.
* **Ease of management:** Admins only need to interact with the CP nodes to
control and monitor the status of the entire Kong cluster.

## Platform compatibility

You can run {{site.ee_product_name}} in Hybrid mode on any platform where
{{site.ee_product_name}} is [supported](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/deployment/installation/overview).

### Kubernetes support and additional documentation
[Kong Enterprise on Kubernetes](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-for-kubernetes/install-on-kubernetes)
fully supports Hybrid mode deployments, with or without the Kong Ingress Controller.

For the full Kubernetes Hybrid mode documentation, see
[Hybrid mode](https://github.com/Kong/charts/blob/main/charts/kong/README.md#hybrid-mode)
in the `kong/charts` repository.

## Limitations

### Configuration inflexibility
When a configuration change is made at the Control Plane level via the Admin
API, it triggers a cluster-wide update of all Data Plane configurations. This
means that the same configuration is synced from the CP to all DPs. For
different DPs to have different configurations, they will need their own CP
instances.

### Plugin incompatibility
When plugins are running on a Data Plane in hybrid mode, there is no Admin API
exposed directly from that DP. Since the Admin API is only exposed from the
Control Plane, all plugin configuration has to occur from the CP. Due to this
setup, and the configuration sync format between the CP and the DP, some plugins
have limitations in Hybrid mode:

* [**Key Auth Encrypted:**](/hub/kong-inc/key-auth-enc) The time-to-live setting
(`ttl`), which determines the length of time a credential remains valid, does
not work in Hybrid mode.
* [**Rate Limiting Advanced:**](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced)
This plugin does not support the `cluster` strategy in Hybrid mode. The `redis`
strategy must be used instead.
* [**OAuth 2.0 Authentication:**](/hub/kong-inc/oauth2) This plugin is not
compatible with Hybrid mode. For its regular workflow, the plugin needs to both
generate and delete tokens, and commit those changes to the database, which is
not possible with CP/DP separation.

### Custom plugins
Custom plugins (either your own plugins or third-party plugins that are not
shipped with Kong) need to be installed on both the Control Plane and the Data
Plane in Hybrid mode.
