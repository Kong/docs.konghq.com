# Accessing your License File

Your license file can be found along with your Kong Enterprise installation package in Bintray. To access Bintray, login here:
(https://bintray.com/login?forwardedFrom=%2Fkong%2F)

> If you are unsure of your Bintray credentials please reach out to your CSE for assistance or contact <support@konghq.com>

Once inside Bintray, you should see a new repository listed with the same name as your company. Clicking on that link will
take you to your repository overview page, with your license file inside.

Click on the link labeled "license", and then navigate to the "files" tab:

You should see a file listed "license.json". Clicking on the filename will start the file download.

Alternatively, you can run the following command in your terminal to download the license file:

```bash
curl -L <u$username>@kong<$api-key>
"https://kong.bintray.com/<$repo-name>/license.json" -o <file.ext>
```

> Please note: This command requires your Bintray API key, not your account password. Once logged into Bintray, you can find your API key by visiting (https://bintray.com/profile/edit) and clicking "API Key" in the menud. Please contact your CSE or <support@konghq.com> if you need assistance accessing your API key.
