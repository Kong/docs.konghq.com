## Introduction

Since [Developers][developers] are a type of [Consumer](/0.13.x/getting-started/adding-consumers/), plugins and auth credentials can be similarly applied to them. In this section we will learn how Developers can get access to your routes and services by managing their credentials.

## How to Manage Your Developer Credentials

As a Developer, once you are [approved](/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/developer-portal/managing-developers/#developers-statuses), you can login to the Dev Portal Dashboard and [create](#creating-a-credential), [update](#updating-a-credential), or [delete](#deleting-a-credential) credentials. The credential options available will be based on which authentication plugins the Kong admin has enabled.

Current plugins supported:

- [ACL](/plugins/acl/)
- [Basic Authentication](/plugins/key-authentication/)
- [Key Authentication](/plugins/key-authentication/)
- [OAuth 2.0](/plugins/basic-authentication/)
- [HMAC Signature Authentication](/plugins/hmac-authentication/)
- [JWT](/plugins/jwt/)

### Creating a Credential

In the Dev Portal Dashboard, click "Create API Credential". Select the Authentication plugin from the dropdown inside the modal window and fill out the form. Click "Create API Credential" inside the modal and you should see a confirmation that the credential was successfully created.

### Updating a Credential

In the Dev Portal Dashboard, find the credential you wish to edit. Click "Edit". Edit the form inside the modal window with updated information, then click "Edit API Credential". You should see a confirmation that the credential was successfully saved.

### Deleting a Credential

> WARNING: This is a destructive action. Deleting a credential means that all applications or services using this credential will no longer have access.

In the Dev Portal Dashboard, find the credential you wish to delete.
