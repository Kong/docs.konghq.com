The support for Kong Enterprise software versions is explained in this topic. 

For customers with an active enterprise support agreement, Kong provides full support for each release for 12 months from the released date. 

Full support includes:

* Technical support on the use of the software as documented, assistance with application configuration, and guidelines on performance tuning. 

* Access to all error corrections, bug fixes, software updates, and software upgrades to the Software that Kong makes generally available to other Kong enterprise customers who have purchased a license to the same Software purchased by Customer. 

* Development of workarounds or patches for customers upon request, and where technically possible, for the following: Urgent issues; Critical and High Security Vulnerabilities; High priority issues where the product in a non-production environment is nearing a critical milestone, is unusable, and no workaround is available.

Bug fixes and patches will be issued against the latest version of Kong Enterprise. For example, if a customer experiences a high priority bug on 0.36 and the latest shipped product is version 1.3.0.2, then the fix for that bug will normally be provided on 1.3.0.3. For customers with platinum or higher support, we will issue fixes to earlier versions upon request, if there are compelling business reasons for remaining on an older release.

> Table 1: End of Support Date

End of life support will be limited to technical assistance only, with no source code patches or new patch level releases. Kong's support team may provide recommendations to the customer, but no software patches will be provided. If there is an issue that requires a patch, customers will need to upgrade to a newer version covered by the full Support Policy.

The above is a summary only and is qualified by Kong's Support and Maintenance Policy.
