title: Adding Dev Portal Registration Fields
---


### Introduction

When authentication is enabled for a Dev Portal, the only required
fields by default are **full name**, **email**, and **password**. However, you
can add custom fields to this form and indicate whether the fields are
required. Adding custom required fields will not affect existing registered
users until they choose to edit their profile.

### Adding Custom Registration Fields

1. In Kong Manager, navigate to the Workspace's Dev Portal **Settings** page.

2. Click the **Developer Meta Fields** tab.

3. Click **+ Add Field** to add a new field object to the form.

4. Enter a label, field name, and select the type of input.

5. Select the **Required** checkbox to require the new field for registration.

6. Click **Save Changes**. The field is automatically added to the registration form.
