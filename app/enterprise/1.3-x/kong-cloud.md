# Kong Cloud  differences from on-premise
Kong Cloud, while being our hosted Kong Enterprise solution, has a few key differences from a self-hosted, on-premise Kong Enterprise cluster.

## Security
By default, RBAC is enabled on both the Kong Manager and Kong Gateway Admin API to prevent unauthorized access to your Kong Enterprise cluster.

A root account named **kong_admin** will be created and provisioned on sign up.

## Kong Manager
In Kong Manager, some parts of the interface that arenâ€™t relevant for a hosted setting due to being either irrelevant, ephemeral or inaccessible from outside of the private network are hidden or disabled. These include license details, database details, and cluster node details.

Certain plugins and plugin fields are also disabled. See plugins section below.

## Plugins
Not all plugins bundled with Kong Enterprise are available in Kong Cloud.
