### Introduction

By default, when authentication is enabled for a Dev Portal the only required
fields are **full name**, **email**, and **password**. However, additional fields can be added
to this form.


### Adding Additional Registration Fields

1. In Kong Manager, navigate to the desired Workspace's Dev Portal **Settings** page.

2. Click the **Developer Meta Fields** tab on the **Settings Page**

3. Click **+ Add Field** to add a new field object to the form.

4. Give the new field a label, field name, and select the type of input

5. Select the checkbox **Required** to require this field for registration

6. Click the **Save Changes** button a the bottom of the form.


Once saved, the new field will automatically be added to the registration form.

Adding new required fields will not affect existing registered users until they choose to edit their profile.
