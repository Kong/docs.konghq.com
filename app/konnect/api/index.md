## Base URLs

There are two types of base URLs that are used in {{site.konnect_short_name}} APIs:

* Global: https://global.api.konghq.com 

* Region specific: https://{REGION_CODE}.api.konghq.com

The global endpoint is used to manage region-agnostic {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities that live in a global database. These APIs interact with entities that are not region specific and therefore do not have any regional boundaries. For example, identity management and IdP settings are all region-agnostic configurations applied to the organization as a whole.

The region-specific endpoints are used to manage {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities that live in a specific {{site.konnect_short_name}} region. These APIs interact with entities specific to a region and do not have the ability to cross regional boundaries. For example, runtime groups, service listings are all region-specific entities and therefore must use the region-specific endpoint.
