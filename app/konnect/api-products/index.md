API Products bundles and manages multiple services. Each API product consists of at least one API product version, and each API product version is connected to a Gateway service. You can document your services and publish API products to a Dev Portal for consumption.



## API Products Dashboard

The API Products Dashboard is the place to manage API products, versions, and documentation. The dashboard is available by clicking any API product within the API Products dashboard. 

Here are some of the things you can do from the API Products Dashboard: 

* Configure an API product
* Publish an API product to the Dev Portal
* Manage API product versions. 
* View traffic, error, and latency data.

| Item | Description
-------|------|------------
**Overview** | Analytics data for the API product. You can configure the analytics options using the [**Analytics tool**](/konnect/analytics/).
**Product Versions** | This section displays the status of an API product version. From the context menu you can **Delete** an API product version, or use the **View Details** button to navigate to that version's dashboard. 
**Documentation** | You can add and edit markdown documentation for your API product, upload API specs, and manage the publishing status for each document. 

{:.note}
> **Note**: API products can only be published to the Dev Portal in the [geographic region](/konnect/geo) you currently have selected. To publish to a Dev Portal in a different region, switch geos using the control in the bottom-left corner of {{site.konnect_product_name}}.

### API product versions

A {{site.konnect_short_name}} API product version is linked to a Gateway service inside a [control plane](/konnect/gateway-manager/#control-planes). As such, the configurations or plugins that are associated with the Gateway service are also associated with the API product version. 

API products can have multiple API product versions, and each version can be linked to a Gateway service. API products can be made available in multiple environments by linking API product versions to Gateway services in different control planes. You can also associate an API spec with a product version and make the spec accessible in the Dev Portal.

A common use case is environment specialization.
For example, if you have three control planes for `development`, `staging`, and
`production`, you can manage which environment the API product version is available in by
linking an API product version to a Gateway service in that control plane. You might have v1 running
in `production`, and be actively working on v2 in `development`. Once it's
ready to test, you'd create v2 in `staging` before finally creating v2 in
`production` alongside v1.


### Analytics

The analytics dashboard shown in the API product **Overview** is a high level overview of **traffic**, **error**, and **latency** for the API product. These reports are generated automatically based on the traffic to the API product.

## Documentation

Manage your API product's documentation directly within the **Documentation** section of the [API Product dashboard](https://cloud.konghq.com/api-products/). After uploading documentation, you can edit it seamlessly from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} dashboard. Documentation is accessible after the API product is published.
