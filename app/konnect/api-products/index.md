Explanation topics are understanding-oriented because they clarify and discuss a particular topic. These topics take a broader view of the software by discussing how something works, the background or context of a topic, what its benefits are, and drawbacks or alternatives.

Explanation topics should start with an introduction paragraph. Good explanation documentation introductions explain who this explanation topic is for and what this topic will cover. 

For example, you could start an explanation introduction paragraph about computers like the following:

"Computers are digital machines that are used to perform operations, both arithmetic and logical, automatically. They can be useful in a variety of situations, such as typing a document, coding software, or watching a video. This guide is for users who are new to computers and explains what computers are, their history, the benefits of using a computer, and drawbacks of using computers."

## First context section <!-- Header optional if there's only one section in the article -->

The first section should be about the main idea of the topic. The title for an explanation section generally starts with a noun. For example, "History of computers".

For example, if you were writing about computers, you could go into more detail about what they do, how they work, and so on. This would expand on the information that was in the introduction paragraph.

> **Note**: You can also use notes to highlight important information. Try to keep them short. 

### Subsection with more details <!-- Optional --> 

Subsections go into more detail about some aspect of the functionality, concept, or bigger picture context of the topic. Subsection titles should also start with a noun. For example, "Computers and the internet".

For example, if you were writing about the larger context of computers in the main section, you could write about the history of computers in this section or the history of a particular computer.
 
Keep in mind that H2 is the highest header level a topic can have. If you are using nested headers, make sure that they're sequential. An H2 can contain an H3, but not the other way around.
 
## Second context section <!-- Optional -->

Additional sections contain more information about another element of your topic. You could write about the benefits and drawbacks of your topic or you could write about how your topic interacts with another part of the software in depth.

For example, if you were writing about computers, this section could cover the benefits of using a computer, with the title "Computer benefits".

"Using a computer has the following benefits:

* Complete tasks in a faster amount of time than if you were completing them manually
* Surf the internet"
