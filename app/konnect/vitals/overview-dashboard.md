The Overview Dashboard provides metrics for Services cataloged by Service Hub within a selected time interval for the following categories: 

* **Traffic**: Total number of HTTP requests.
* **Errors**: Percentage of failed HTTP requests. 

Each category measures trends by comparing metrics week-over-week. Time periods for trends are fixed to the last seven days and do not change if you select a different time period from the week before.

You can view a graph for each category by clicking **Traffic** or **Errors**, and switching between the two views.

* **Traffic** - this graph displays total number of HTTP requests categorized by succesful and failed requests over the specified time interval.

* **Errors** â€“  this graph displays the total number of failed HTTP requests categorized by error response codes over the specified time interval.

Graphs can be interacted with, including hovering over chart items to display more details, and filtering options by clicking on items in the **legend**. 

You can select a different time periods using the **time period** drop-down menu. The different intervals aggregate data at different increments of time.
