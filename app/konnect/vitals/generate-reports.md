Create custom reports to track API calls based on Services, Routes, or
Applications.

{:.note}
> **Note:** If you select multiple Service versions in a report, the report
shows the sum of requests for all selected versions broken down by Service.
It does not show data points for individual Service versions.

## View custom reports

To access all custom reports, open {% konnect_icon vitals %}
**Vitals** from the left side menu in Konnect, then **Reports**.
This brings you to a list of all custom reports in the organization.

Click on any report in the table to view it. From the report's details page, you
can [export](#export-a-custom-report), [edit](#edit-a-custom-report), or [delete](#delete-a-custom-report) the report.

## Create a custom report

1. From the left-side menu in Konnect, open {% konnect_icon vitals %}
**Vitals**, then **Reports**.
1. Click the button to **Add New Report**.
1. Name the report and optionally add a description.

    The name and description fields each have a 255 character limit.

1. Choose a time frame to display.

    You can choose a preset time frame ranging from 1 day to 1 year, or
    select **Custom** to set any date range.

    All time frames are static. The report will capture a snapshot of data
    in whichever time frame you choose, but the range always stops at the time
    that the report was created. You can see a preview of the exact range below
    the time frame selector. For example:

    ```
    Sunday, Jun 12, 9:57:45 AM (CEST) to Monday, Jun 13, 9:57:45 AM (CEST)
    ```


1. Choose a report type.

   * **Service report**: Generate a report based on Services.
   * **Route report**: Generate a report based on Routes.
   * **Application report**: Generate a report based on API consumers.

   Depending on the report type you choose, the available metrics and entities
   will change.

1. Choose a [metric](#metrics) to group the data by.
1. Choose the entities to focus on in your report.
1. Click **Create**.

The report details page opens. Here you can:

* **View details**: Hover over a bar on the graph to see details about the data.
* **Filter the graph**: Click on an item in the legend to temporarily hide it from view,
and click it again to show the item. The graph resets on a refresh.
