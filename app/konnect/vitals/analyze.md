In the Service Hub, the Service, Service version, and Route graphs provide dynamic
graphs with up to 12 hours of data. To view data beyond this time frame, export
the data into a comma-separated values (CSV) file.

You can generate and export a CSV file for:

* A Service, including daily requests by status codes for all versions of the
Service.
* A Service version, including a report of daily requests and status codes.

For a Route, you can [view status codes](#view-performance-for-a-route)
for a specified time frame but you can't export a Route traffic report through
Service Hub.

If you want to combine multiple Services, Routes, or Applications in one report,
see [custom reports](/konnect/vitals/generate-reports/).
