You can change a Free or Plus subscription at any time from {{site.konnect_saas}}.

If you downgrade from Plus in the middle of a cycle, your plan immediately
changes to the new tier. Your monthly charges are prorated and you are billed
on your actual usage.

Use the [Billing and Usage](/konnect/account-management) page in {{site.konnect_saas}} to
change your plan. The **Plan Details** section lists your current plan, along
with options to change or cancel it.

## Upgrade a plan

### Upgrade from Free to Plus

1. From the **Billing and Usage** page, click **Change Plan**.
2. On the **Plus** tile, click **Upgrade**.
3. Enter your billing details.

    You are not billed at sign-up. Users are billed monthly on the
    subscription date, and charges are calculated three (3) days before the
    billing date.

4. Click **Subscribe** to save and return to the **Billing and Usage** overview.

    Your plan should now display as {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus.

    A sales representative from Kong will contact you to discuss your use case,
    walk you through any demos you need, and work with you to create a plan that
    fits your needs.


## Downgrade a plan

### Downgrade from Plus to Free

1. From the **Billing and Usage** page, click **Cancel Plan**.
2. Click **Confirm Downgrade** to save and return to the **Billing and Usage**
overview.

    With a downgrade, your monthly charges are prorated and you are billed
    on your actual usage.

### Downgrade from Enterprise to Plus
