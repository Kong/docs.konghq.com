You can change a Free or Plus subscription at any time from {{site.konnect_saas}}.

If you downgrade from Plus in the middle of a cycle, your plan immediately
changes to the new tier. Your monthly charges are prorated and you are billed
on your actual usage.

Use the [Billing and Usage](/konnect/account-management) page in {{site.konnect_saas}} to
change your plan. The **Plan Details** section lists your current plan, along
with options to change or cancel it.
