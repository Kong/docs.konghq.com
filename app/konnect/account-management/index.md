{{site.konnect_product_name}} offers [two plans](https://konghq.com/pricing). 

* {{site.konnect_product_name}} Plus 
* {{site.konnect_product_name}} Enterprise

{{site.konnect_product_name}} Plus is the simplest way to get started with {{site.konnect_product_name}}, allowing you to only pay for the services you consume. New accounts are automatically given a month of free credits as part of 30-day trial. 

{{site.konnect_product_name}} Enterprise is our contract-based option that includes 24x7x365 support and professional services access to help you build and maintain your own custom environment. 

You can claim your Konnect Plus credits by [signing up](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register). Or learn more about enterprise on our [pricing page](https://konghq.com/pricing)

## Manage and view plan billing and usage

You can view service, Dev Portal, and API call usage from the [Billing and Usage](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/plan-and-usage/).

Here you can review your billable consumption of {{site.konnect_product_name}} and manage billing and payment information.


If you want to upgrade to {{site.konnect_product_name}} Enterprise, [contact a sales representative](https://konghq.com/contact-sales).

## License management

When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, {{site.ee_product_name}}, {{site.kic_product_name}} (KIC), and {{site.mesh_product_name}}
licenses are automatically provisioned to the organization. You do not need to manage these
licenses manually.

Any data plane nodes or {{site.kic_product_name}} associations configured through the [Gateway Manager](/konnect/gateway-manager/)
also implicitly receive the same license from the {{site.konnect_saas}}
control plane. You should never have to deal with a license directly.

For any license questions, contact your sales representative.

## Geographic region management

When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, you select a [geographic region](/konnect/geo) for your instance. Geos are distinct deployments of {{site.konnect_short_name}} with objects, such as services and consumers, that are geo-specific. Only authentication is shared between {{site.konnect_short_name}} geos.
