title: Konnect Plans, Billing, and Usage
content_type: explanation
---

{{site.konnect_product_name}} has [three plans](https://konghq.com/pricing) to
choose from: Free, Plus, and Enterprise. When you first sign up, you get
automatically enrolled into a 30-day free trial for {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus. At the end of
this trial, you can choose to continue with Plus, or downgrade to Free.

There is no self-serve option for managing Enterprise plans.
Contact your sales representative to make any changes.

## License management

When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, a license is
automatically provisioned to the organization. You do not need to manage this
license manually.

Any data plane nodes configured through the [Gateway Manager](/konnect/gateway-manager/)
also implicitly receive the same license from the {{site.konnect_saas}}
control plane. You should never have to deal with a license
directly.

For any license questions, contact your sales representative.

## Manage and view plan billing and usage

You can view service, Dev Portal, and API call usage from the [Billing and Usage](https://cloud.konghq.com/settings/billing-settings)
settings page, and manage your {{site.konnect_short_name}} Free or Plus plan from this page.

This page provides an overview of your current plan, including:

* The plan name
* An estimated cost for the month (not available for trial accounts)
* The total count of all services and API products published to Dev Portal, and API calls for
the current month

For Free and Plus plans, you can:
* [Modify or cancel your plan](/konnect/account-management/change-plan/)
* [Set up or modify a payment method](/konnect/account-management/billing#modify-a-payment-method)
* [Pay an invoice](/konnect/account-management/billing#pay-an-invoice)
* [Check billing history](/konnect/account-management/billing#view-billing-history)

If you want to upgrade to Enterprise, you can use the billing page to [contact a sales representative](/konnect/account-management/change-plan/#upgrade-from-any-plan-to-enterprise).
