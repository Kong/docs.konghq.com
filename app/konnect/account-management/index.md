{{site.konnect_product_name}} offers [two plans](https://konghq.com/pricing). 

* {{site.konnect_product_name}} Plus 
* {{site.konnect_product_name}} Enterprise

{{site.konnect_product_name}} Plus is the simplest way to get started with {{site.konnect_product_name}}, allowing you to only pay for the services you consume. New accounts are automatically given 1,000 free credits as part of 30-day trial. 

Enterprise is our contract-based option that includes 24x7x365 support and professional services access to help you build and maintain your own custom environment. 

You can claim your Konnect Plus credits by [signing up](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register). Or learn more about enterprise on our [pricing page](https://konghq.com/pricing)

## Manage and view plan billing and usage

You can view service, Dev Portal, and API call usage from the [Billing and Usage](https://cloud.konghq.com/settings/billing-settings)

![Billing Page](/assets/images/docs/konnect/billing/billing-and-usage.png)

Here you can: 

* Review analytics for:
    * Usage
    * Partition hours
    * Ingress and Egress
* View invoices
* Manage billing and payment information.

If you want to upgrade to Enterprise, you can use the billing page to [contact a sales representative](/konnect/account-management/change-plan/#upgrade-from-any-plan-to-enterprise).

## License management

When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, a license is
automatically provisioned to the organization. You do not need to manage this
license manually.

Any data plane nodes configured through the [Gateway Manager](/konnect/gateway-manager/)
also implicitly receive the same license from the {{site.konnect_saas}}
control plane. You should never have to deal with a license
directly.

For any license questions, contact your sales representative.
