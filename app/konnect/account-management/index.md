{{site.konnect_product_name}} has [three plans](https://konghq.com/pricing) to
choose from: Free, Plus, and Enterprise. When you first sign up, you get
automatically enrolled into a 30-day free trial for {{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus. At the end of
this trial, you can choose to continue with Plus, or downgrade to Free.

You can view service, Dev Portal, and API call usage from the **Billing and Usage**
settings page, and manage your {{site.konnect_short_name}} Free or Plus plan from this page.

There is no self-serve option for managing Enterprise plans.
Contact your sales representative to make any changes.

## License management

When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, a license is
automatically provisioned to the organization. You do not need to manage this
license manually.

Any runtimes configured through the [Runtime Manager](/konnect/runtime-manager)
also implicitly receive the same license from {{site.konnect_saas}}
control plane. You should never have to deal with a license
directly.

For any license questions, contact your sales representative.
