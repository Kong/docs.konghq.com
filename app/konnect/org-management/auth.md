content_type: explanation

Secure your {{site.konnect_saas}} organization by setting up teams and roles,
or enable an external authenticator to manage
{{site.konnect_saas}} authentication and authorization from your own identity
provider. {{site.konnect_saas}} offers multiple options for authentication. The [generic SSO](/konnect/org-management/sso/) with SAML and OIDC allow you to configure authentication with any identity provider that supports these protocols. 
The [Okta](/konnect/org-management/okta-idp/) specific setup offers an integrated approach for Okta users, supporting both OIDC and SAML, and includes features like team mappings and dashboard integration.
