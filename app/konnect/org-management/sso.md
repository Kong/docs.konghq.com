title: Configure generic SSO for a Konnect Org
---


As an alternative to {{site.konnect_saas}}â€™s native authentication, you can set up single sign-on (SSO) access to {{site.konnect_short_name}} using OpenID Connect or SAML. This authentication method allows your users to log in to {{site.konnect_saas}} using their IdP credentials, without needing a separate login. This topic covers configuring SSO for use with various identity providers. 

If you want to configure Okta, please see the [Okta configuration guide](/konnect/org-management/okta-idp/).
