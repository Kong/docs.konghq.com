title: Set Up SSO with Okta
badge: enterprise
---


As an alternative to {{site.konnect_saas}}â€™s native authentication, you can set up single sign-on (SSO) access to {{site.konnect_short_name}} through Okta using OpenID Connect or SAML. These authentication methods allow your users to log in to {{site.konnect_saas}} using their Okta credentials without needing a separate login. 

You cannot mix authenticators in {{site.konnect_saas}}. With Okta authentication enabled, all non-admin {{site.konnect_short_name}} users will log in through Okta. Only the {{site.konnect_short_name}} org owner can continue to log in with {{site.konnect_short_name}}'s native authentication.

This topic covers configuring Okta. For generic instructions on configuring SAML or OIDC for use with other identity providers, see the [generic SSO guide](/konnect/org-management/sso/).
