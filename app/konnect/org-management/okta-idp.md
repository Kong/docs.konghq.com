title: Set Up Okta IdP Authentication
no_version: true
badge: enterprise
---

As an alternative to Konnect Cloudâ€™s native basic authentication, you can set up
org access through Okta. This way, your users can log in to Konnect Cloud
using their Okta credentials, and without needing a separate login.

You can't mix authenticators in Konnect Cloud. With Okta IdP
authentication enabled, all non-admin Konnect users will subsequently log in
through Okta. Only Konnect admins can continue to log in with basic
authentication.

> This feature is only available with Kong Konnect Enterprise.

## Prerequisites
* [**Organization Admin**](/konnect/reference/org-management/#role-definitions)
permissions in Konnect Cloud
* [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/)
