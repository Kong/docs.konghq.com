You can invite users to join your Konnect organization through the **Organization**
page.

To manage user access, see [Manage Teams and Roles](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles).

{:.note}
> **Note:** If Okta integration is [enabled](/konnect/org-management/okta-idp),
{{site.konnect_short_name}} users and teams become read-only. An organization
admin can view all registered users in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, but cannot
edit their team membership from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} side. To manage
automatically-created users, adjust user permissions through Okta, or
[adjust team mapping](/konnect/org-management/okta-idp/#map-teams-to-groups).

## Add a user to the organization

### Invite a user
1. In {{site.konnect_saas}}, open the {% konnect_icon organizations %}
 **Organization > Users** page.
1. Select **Invite User**.
1. Enter the userâ€™s name and email.
1. Assign the user to one or more teams.

    For team descriptions, hover over the information (`i`) icon next to the team name,
    or see the [predefined teams references](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/teams-reference).

    An email invitation is sent to the user.

   assigned teams and roles. Select
   **Actions > Add/Remove** to change the user's team membership.
