You can invite users to join your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization through the {% konnect_icon organizations %} **Organization** > **Users** page.

To manage user access, see [Manage Teams and Roles](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles).

From the Users page, you can:
* View usernames, email addresses, assigned team(s), and assigned individual role(s).
* Manage team assignment
* Manage individual roles

For users that have been invited but haven't set up an account yet, a **pending** indicator displays by their name.

{:.note}
> **Note:** If Okta integration is [enabled](/konnect/org-management/okta-idp),
{{site.konnect_short_name}} users and teams become read-only. An organization
admin can view all registered users in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, but cannot
edit their team membership from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} side. To manage
automatically-created users, adjust user permissions through Okta, or
[adjust team mapping](/konnect/org-management/okta-idp/#map-teams-to-groups).
