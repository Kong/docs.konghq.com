You can use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Organization Settings API to configure webhooks for [audit logging](/konnect/org-management/audit-logging). 

Webhooks are invoked via an HTTP request using the following retry rules:

- Minimum retry wait time: 1 second
- Maximum retry wait time: 30 seconds
- Maximum number of retries: 4

A retry is performed on connection error, server error (`500` HTTP status code), or too many requests (`429` HTTP status code).

## Prerequisites

Before you can push {{site.konnect_short_name}} audit logs to an external service, you need to configure the service to receive logs. 
This configuration is specific to your vendor.

You can configure a webhook into any application that supports the [ArcSight CEF Format](https://docs.centrify.com/Content/IntegrationContent/SIEM/arcsight-cef/arcsight-cef-format.htm).

1. In your log collection service, configure a data collection endpoint to push logs to.

2. Take note of the authorization credentials that you need to access this endpoint. {{site.konnect_short_name}} supports any HTTP authorization header type.

## Create a webhook

Now that you have an external endpoint and authorization credentials, you can set up a webhook in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

Create a webhook by sending a `PUT` request to the `/audit-log-webhook` endpoint with the connection details for your SIEM vendor:

```sh
curl -i -X PUT https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/audit-log-webhook \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer PAT" \
    --data '{"endpoint":"https://example.com/audit-logs","enabled":true,"authorization":"example-token"}'
```

Replace the following placeholders with your own data:
* `PAT`: A {{site.konnect_short_name}} [personal access token](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/tokens) for the organization that you're tracking.
* `"endpoint":"https://example.com/audit-logs"`: The external endpoint that will receive audit log messages.
* `"authorization":"Bearer example-token"`: The authorization type and credential to pass to your log collection endpoint. 
{{site.konnect_short_name}} will send this string in the `Authorization` header of requests to that endpoint.

    For example, if you are setting up the webhook for Splunk, you could provide a Splunk access token: `"authorization":"Splunk example-token12234352535235"`

If the request is successful, you will receive a `200` response code, and a response body containing the webhook's configuration details: 

```json
{
    "endpoint":"https://example.com/audit-logs",
    "enabled":true
}
```

You should now start receiving logs at your endpoint from the configured organization. 

## View webhook configuration

You can view your audit log webhook configuration by running the following command:

```sh
curl https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/audit-log-webhook \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer PAT"
```

You will receive a `200` response code and the following data, with the authorization value hidden:

```json
{
    "endpoint":"https://example.com/audit-logs",
    "enabled":true
}
```
