title: Set up an audit log webhook
content_type: how-to

You can use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI or the Audit Logs API to configure webhooks for [audit logging](/konnect/org-management/audit-logging/). 

Webhooks are invoked via an HTTP request using the following retry rules:

- Minimum retry wait time: 1 second
- Maximum retry wait time: 30 seconds
- Maximum number of retries: 4

A retry is performed on connection error, server error (`500` HTTP status code), or too many requests (`429` HTTP status code).

## Prerequisites

You must have **Org Admin** permissions to set up audit log webhooks.

Before you can push {{site.konnect_short_name}} audit logs to an external service, you also need to configure the service to receive logs. 
This configuration is specific to your vendor.

You can configure a webhook into any application that supports the [ArcSight CEF Format](https://docs.centrify.com/Content/IntegrationContent/SIEM/arcsight-cef/arcsight-cef-format.htm) or raw JSON.

1. Check your SIEM documentation to find out where to send CEF or raw JSON data.

1. In your log collection service, configure a data collection endpoint to push logs to.

1. Take note of the authorization credentials that you need to access this endpoint. {{site.konnect_short_name}} supports any HTTP authorization header type.

1. Configure your firewall settings to allow traffic through the port that you're going to use. 
See the [Konnect ports and network requirements](/konnect/network/).

## Create a webhook

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Konnect UI %}

1. From the navigation menu, open {% konnect_icon organizations %} **Organization**, then **Audit Logs Setup**.
1. Fill in the fields in the **Setup** tab.
   * **Region endpoint**: The external endpoint that will receive audit log messages. 
   * **Authorization Header**: The authorization type and credential to pass to your log collection endpoint. 
    {{site.konnect_short_name}} will send this string in the `Authorization` header of requests to that endpoint.

     For example, if you are setting up the webhook for Splunk, you could provide a Splunk access token: 
     `"authorization":"Splunk example-token12234352535235"`.
        
    * **Log Format**: The output format of each log message. Can be CEF or JSON.
1. Switch the toggle to `Enabled`, then save your webhook configuration.

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab API %}

Now that you have an external endpoint and authorization credentials, you can set up a webhook in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

Create a webhook by sending a request to the `/audit-log-webhook` endpoint with the connection details for your SIEM vendor:

```sh
curl -i -X PATCH https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/audit-log-webhook \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
    --data '{"endpoint":"https://example.com/audit-logs","enabled":true,"authorization":"Bearer example-token","log_format":"cef"}'
```

Replace the following placeholders with your own data:
* `global.api.konghq.com`: The region your org is in. Can be `global` to target all regions, `us`, or `eu`.
* `TOKEN`: A {{site.konnect_short_name}} [personal access token](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/tokens) or 
  [system account token](/konnect/org-management/system-accounts/).
* `"endpoint":"https://example.com/audit-logs"`: The external endpoint that will receive audit log messages. 
   
   {:.note}
    > Check your SIEM documentation to find out where to send CEF data.
    
* `"authorization":"Bearer example-token"`: The authorization type and credential to pass to your log collection endpoint. 
{{site.konnect_short_name}} will send this string in the `Authorization` header of requests to that endpoint.

    For example, if you are setting up the webhook for Splunk, you could provide a Splunk access token: `"authorization":"Splunk example-token12234352535235"`.

* `log_format`: The output format of each log message. Can be `cef` or `json`.

If the request is successful, you will receive a `200` response code, and a response body containing the webhook's configuration details: 

```json
{
    "endpoint":"https://example.com/audit-logs",
    "log_format":"cef",
    "enabled":true,
    "updated_at":"2023-04-01T00:00:01Z"
}
```

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

Your webhook should now start receiving audit logs. 

## View webhook configuration and status

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Konnect UI %}

You can view the status of your webhook through the **Audit Logs Setup** page under 
{% konnect_icon organizations %} **Organization**.

Notice the status badge next to title of the webhook. For example, the following webhook is active:

![Audit log webhook](/assets/images/docs/konnect/konnect-audit-log-webhook.png)

To find the last attempt timestamp and the last response code, use the audit log API.

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab API %}

View your audit log webhook configuration by running the following command:

```sh
curl https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/audit-log-webhook \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

You will receive a `200` response code and the following data. Note that the `authorization` property is not included in any responses:

```json
{
    "endpoint":"https://example.com/audit-logs",
    "log_format":"cef",
    "enabled":true,
    "updated_at":"2023-04-01T00:00:01Z"
}
```

View your audit log webhook status by running the following command:

```sh
curl https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/audit-log-webhook/status \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

You will receive a `200` response code and a response body with information about the webhook status:

```json
{
    "last_attempt_at": "2023-04-04T18:11:16Z",
    "last_response_code": 200,
    "webhook_enabled": true,
    "webhook_status": "active"
}
```

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

The attributes are defined as follows:

attribute | definition
--------- | ----------
`last_attempt at` | The last time {{site.konnect_short_name}} tried to send data to your webhook
`last_response_code` | The last response code from your webhook
`webhook_enabled` | The desired status of the webhook (from `audit-log-webhook.enabled`)
`webhook_status` | The actual status {{site.konnect_short_name}} of the webhook

A combination of `webhook_enabled` and `webhook_status` give a full picture of webhook status.

`webhook_enabled` | `webhook_status` | definition
--------------- | -------------- | ----------
true            | `active`       | {{site.konnect_short_name}} is ready to ship data to the webhook. Either no attempts have been made yet (`last_attempt_at` is not set), or the last attempt was successful.
true            | `inactive`     | Last attempt to send data failed, but customer wants data to resume.
false           | `active`       | Webhook config is saved. {{site.konnect_short_name}} is not shipping data to it per webhook configuration.
false           | `inactive`     |Last attempt to send data failed, and customer has turned off the webhook.
false           | `unconfigured` | The webhook for this region has not been configured yet.
