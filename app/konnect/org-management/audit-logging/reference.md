{{site.konnect_short_name}} captures three types of events:

* **Authentication**: Triggered when a user attempts to log into the {{site.konnect_short_name}} web application or use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API via a personal access token. Also triggered when a system account access token is used.
* **Authorization**: Triggered when a permission check is made for a user or system account against a resource.
* **Access logs**: Triggered when a request is made to the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API.

## Log format

{{site.konnect_short_name}} delivers log events in [ArcSight CEF Format](https://docs.centrify.com/Content/IntegrationContent/SIEM/arcsight-cef/arcsight-cef-format.htm). Webhook calls include a batch of events, where each event is formatted in CEF and separated by a newline. The `Content-Type` is `application/text`.

To minimize payload size, the message body is compressed. The `Content-Encoding` is `application/gzip`.

All log entries include the following attributes:

Property | Description
---------|-------------
Timestamp | Time and date of the event in UTC.
`rt` | Milliseconds since Unix epoch.
`src` | The IP address of the request originator.
`org_id` | The originating organization ID.
`principal_id` | The user ID of the user that performed the action.
`kong_initiated` | Whether the action was performed by Kong
`trace_id` | The correlation ID of the request. Use this value to find all log entries for a given request.
`user_agent` | The user agent of the request: application, operating system, vendor, and version.

## Authentication logs

Authentication attempts and their outcomes are logged whenever a user logs in to the Konnect application or uses the Konnect API.

Example log entry:
