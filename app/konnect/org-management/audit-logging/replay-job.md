You can use the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Audit Logs API to configure replay jobs for [audit logging](/konnect/org-management/audit-logging/). 

Replay jobs are useful when you have missed audit log entries due to an error or a misconfigured audit
log webhook. You may have one replay job at a time per region, and request data from up to one week ago.
A replay job in a region will resend data for the requested timeframe to the webhook configured for that region.

## Prerequisites

Before you can request a replay job:
* You must have **Org Admin** permissions.
* Your [audit log webhook](/konnect/org-management/audit-logging/webhook/) must be enabled and ready to receive data. 


## Configure a replay job

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Konnect UI %}

1. From the navigation menu, open {% konnect_icon organizations %} **Organization**, then **Audit Logs Setup**.
1. Switch to the **Replay** tab.
1. Choose a timeframe for which you want to replay the logs. 

   You can choose one of the preset relative increments for up to 24 hours, or 
   set a custom timeframe for up to 7 days.

1. Apply the timeframe, then click **Send Replay**.

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab API %}

Configure the replay job for a region by sending a `PUT` request to `/audit-log-replay-job` in the region where you want to retrieve data. 
The following example creates an `audit-log-replay-job` in the `us` region:

```sh
curl -i -X PUT https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/audit-log-replay-job \
    --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
    --data '{"start_at":"2023-03-27T20:00:00Z","end_at":"2023-03-27T20:00:00Z"}'
```

Replace the following placeholders with your own data:
* `global.api.konghq.com`: The region your org is in. Can be `global` to target all regions, `us`, or `eu`.
* `TOKEN`: A {{site.konnect_short_name}} [personal access token](https://cloud.konghq.com/global/tokens) or 
  [system account token](/konnect/org-management/system-accounts/).
* `start_at` and `end_at`: Specify the timeframe for which you want to receive audit log events. `start_at` must be no more than seven days ago.

If the request is successful, you will receive a `202` response code and a response body containing the replay job details: 

```json
{
    "start_at":"2023-03-27T20:00:00Z",
    "end_at":"2023-03-27T20:00:00Z",
    "updated_at":"2023-03-31T11:34:18Z",
    "status":"accepted"
}
```

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

## View replay job

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Konnect UI %}

1. From the navigation menu, open {% konnect_icon organizations %} **Organization**, then **Audit Logs Setup**.
1. Switch to the **Replay** tab.
1. Check the status table below the configuration field.

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab API %}


You can view the audit log replay job in a given region by issuing a GET request. 
The following example retrieves an `audit-log-replay-job` in the `us` region:

```sh
curl https://global.api.konghq.com/v2/audit-log-replay-job \
    --header "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN"
```

You will receive a `200` response code and the job details:

```json
{
    "start_at":"2023-03-27T20:00:00Z",
    "end_at":"2023-03-27T20:00:00Z",
    "updated_at":"2023-03-31T11:34:18Z",
    "status":"accepted"
}
```

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

## Replay job status

A replay job can be in one of the following statuses:

* `unconfigured`: Initial state. The job has not been set up.
* `accepted`: The job has been accepted for scheduling.
* `pending`: The job has been scheduled.
* `running`: The job is in progress.
* `completed`: The job has finished with no errors.
* `failed`: The job has failed.

When a replay job is `running`, a request to update the job will return a `409` response code until it has completed or failed.
