By mapping Okta groups to Konnect groups, you can also manage authorization through
your Okta app.

If your org already has non-admin Konnect users, they will be mapped to the Okta
application.

## Prerequisites
* [**Organization Admin**](/konnect/reference/org-management/#role-definitions)
permissions in Konnect Cloud
* [Okta developer account](https://developer.okta.com/)
* Okta authentication enabled for {{site.konnect_saas}}

## Set up groups in Okta
