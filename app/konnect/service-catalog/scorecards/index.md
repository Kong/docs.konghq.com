title: Service Catalog Scorecards
beta: true
---

Scorecards in {{site.service_catalog_name}} allow platform teams to monitor services for compliance with Kong-recommended and industry-defined best practices in {{site.konnect_saas}}. By [integrating](/konnect/service-catalog/integrations/) Service Catalog with third-party applications, you can also use those in scorecard criteria.

When you enable a scorecard, you can choose from criteria that you want the service to report on. For example, you can track if an on-call engineer is assigned in PagerDuty or the number of open PRs in a GitHub repository. From the scorecard view, you can see how many services are passing or failing a criteria, and which specific services those are.

## Scorecard templates

{{site.konnect_short_name}} provides several scorecard templates to help ensure your services adhere to industry best practices.

| Scorecard template | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Service documentation | Evaluates how well a serviceâ€™s documentation, including API specs, adheres to [OpenAPI industry standards](https://apistylebook.stoplight.io/). |
| Service maturity | Helps you determine how mature your services are based on criteria that use the [PagerDuty](/konnect/service-catalog/integrations/pagerduty/) and [GitHub](/konnect/service-catalog/integrations/github/) integrations. |
| Kong best practices | Determines how well your services adhere to Kong's best practice standards for Kong's features, such as [Gateway Services](/konnect/gateway-manager/configuration/#gateway-services). |
