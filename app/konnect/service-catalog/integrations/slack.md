The Slack integration allows you to see communication channels (via [Slack channels](https://slack.com/help/articles/360017938993-What-is-a-channel)) that are relevant to a Service Catalog service.

## Authenticate the Slack integration

1. From the **{% konnect_icon servicehub %} Service Catalog** in {{site.konnect_product_name}}, select **[Integrations](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/service-catalog/integrations)**. 
2. Select **Slack**, then **Install Slack**.
3. Select **Authorize**. 
   Only Slack admins can authorize the integration.

Slack will ask you to grant consent to {{site.konnect_product_name}}. Both read and write scopes are required.
