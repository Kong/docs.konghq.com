Integrations are applications - either {{site.konnect_short_name}}-internal applications or external 
third-party applications - that you can enable or disable within {{site.service_catalog_name}}.

When enabled, an integration gives you and your teams the ability to:
* Discover new resources
* Create new services based on existing resources
* View key events associated with the integration directly in the event tab in {{site.konnect_saas}}. 

## Integrations

## Events

Eventing allows you to view key events associated with your {{site.service_catalog_name}} integrations directly from the Events tab in the {{site.konnect_saas}} UI. From here you can search or filter through events by keywords in the event title and filter by time frame.
