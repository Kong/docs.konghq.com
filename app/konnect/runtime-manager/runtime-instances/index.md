A runtime instance is a single self-managed instance of {{site.base_gateway}} that functions as a data plane. In {{site.konnect_saas}}, runtime instances are part of [runtime groups](/konnect/runtime-manager/runtime-groups) and can be used to serve traffic to the runtime group. Runtime groups manage and store configuration in {{site.konnect_saas}}, and runtime instances are configured according to the configuration distributed by the runtime group.

{{site.konnect_short_name}} provides runtime instance installation scripts for various platforms. 
These runtime instances are configured to run in your {{site.konnect_short_name}} environment.

## Supported installation options

You can set up a runtime instance by navigating to {% konnect_icon runtimes %} [**Runtime Manager**](https://cloud.konghq.com/runtime-manager/), choosing a runtime group, then clicking on **New Runtime Instance**.

This brings you to a set of installation options. Choose one of the options, then follow the instructions in {{site.konnect_short_name}} to finish setting up.

{{site.konnect_short_name}} supports the following installation options:

{% include install.html config=site.data.tables.install_options_konnect header='no-header' %}

> **Notes:** 
> * Runtime Manager includes a feature called Runtime Launcher which can be used with any of AWS, Azure, or GCP. This feature is currently in tech preview.
> * Kong does not host runtime instances. You must install and host your own.
> * Runtime Manager allows users to select the {{site.base_gateway}} version that they want for their Quickstart scripts (except for cloud provider quickstart scripts for AWS, Azure, and GCP). This allows you to leverage official {{site.konnect_short_name}} scripts to start your gateways while reducing the number of errors due to an invalid script for a certain {{site.base_gateway}} version.

### Forward proxy support

{{site.konnect_product_name}} supports using non-transparent forward proxies to connect your {{site.base_gateway}} data plane with the {{site.konnect_saas}} control plane. See the [Forward proxy connections](/gateway/latest/production/networking/cp-dp-proxy/){{site.base_gateway}} documentation for more information.
