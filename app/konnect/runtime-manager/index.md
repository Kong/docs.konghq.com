title: About Runtime Manager
---

The [Runtime Manager](https://cloud.konghq.com/runtime-manager)
is a {{site.konnect_saas}} functionality module
that lets you catalogue, connect to, and monitor the status of all runtime
groups and instances in one place, as well as manage group configuration.

The Runtime Manager overview page displays a list of
runtime groups currently owned by the organization. From here, you can add or
delete runtime groups, or go into each individual group to manage runtime
instances and their global configuration.

> _**Figure 1:** Example Runtime Manager dashboard with several runtime groups, including the default group, a KIC runtime group, and groups for development and production._

With {{site.konnect_short_name}} acting as the control plane, a runtime instance
doesn't need a database to store configuration data. Instead, configuration
is stored in-memory on each node, and you can easily update all runtime instances
in a group with a few clicks.

The Runtime Manager, and the {{site.konnect_saas}} application as
a whole, does not have access or visibility into the data flowing through your
runtimes, and it does not store any data except the state and connection details
for each runtime instance.

## Runtime groups

{{site.konnect_short_name}} manages runtime configuration in runtime groups. 

Runtime groups come in two types:

* [**Standard runtime group**](#standard-runtime-groups): 
    A collection of API connectivity runtime instances
    sharing the same configuration and behavior space. Each runtime group acts
    as a separate control plane and can manage runtime configurations independently
    of any other group.

* [**Composite runtime group**](#composite-runtime-groups) <span class="badge enterprise"></span>: 
    A type of runtime group that lets teams share a cluster of {{site.base_gateway}} runtime instances, where each team has its own segregated configuration.

You can find a list of all runtime groups in your organization
on the [Runtime Manager overview](https://cloud.konghq.com/runtime-manager/).

Access to each runtime group is configurable on a team-by-team basis using
entity-specific permissions. For more information, see [Administer teams](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/).

### Standard runtime groups

Every region in every organization starts with one default runtime group. 
This group can't be deleted, and its status as the default group can't be changed.

With an [Enterprise subscription](https://konghq.com/pricing/), you can configure additional
custom runtime groups. Use multiple groups in one {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization to
manage runtime instances and their configuration in any groupings you want.

Some common use cases for using multiple standard runtime groups include:

* **Environment separation:** Split environments based on their purpose, such as
development, staging, and production.
* **Region separation:** Dedicate each runtime group to a region or group of
regions. Spin up runtime instances in those regions for each runtime group.
* **Team separation:** Dedicate each runtime group to a different team and share
resources based on team purpose.

> _**Figure 1:** Example runtime group configuration with three runtime groups: the default group, a development group, and a production group. {{site.konnect_short_name}} is the SaaS-managed global management plane that controls all of the groups, while the runtime groups contain self-managed runtime instances._

#### Runtime group configuration

For each runtime group, you can spin up runtime instances and configure
the following {{site.base_gateway}} entities:
* Gateway services
* Routes
* Consumers
* Consumer Groups
* Plugins
* Upstreams
* Certificates
* SNIs
* Vaults
* Keys

When there are multiple runtime groups, any entity configuration only
applies to the runtime group that it was created in. Consumers and
their authentication mechanisms don't carry over to other runtime groups.

### Composite runtime groups
{:.badge .enterprise}

A composite runtime group is a read-only group that combines configuration from
its members, which are standard runtime groups. All of the members of a 
composite runtime group share the same cluster of runtime instances.

The benefits of a composite runtime group include:
* **Shared infrastructure, individual config**: Users or organizations can share infrastructure, 
while teams still have their own standard runtime groups to manage individual configuration.
* **Modular clusters**: Combine standard runtime groups in different ways to create unique configurations
for different purposes.
* **Workspaces in the cloud**: Composite runtime groups function similarly to {{site.base_gateway}} workspaces, with the added benefit of a cloud control plane.

* [Conflicts in runtime groups](/konnect/runtime-manager/composite-runtime-groups/conflicts/)

### Runtime group dashboard

For each runtime group, you can view traffic, error rate, and {{site.base_gateway}} service analytics for instances in a runtime group. This allows you to see how much of a runtime group is used. You can also select the time frame of analytics that you want to display.

### Deleting a runtime group

{:.warning}
> **Warning:** Deleting a group is irreversible. Make sure that you are
certain that you want to delete the group, and that all entities and runtime
instances in the have been accounted for.

To delete a runtime group, you can use the Runtime Manager or the 
{{site.konnect_short_name}} 
[Runtime Groups API](https://developer.konghq.com/spec/cd849478-4628-4bc2-abcd-5d8a83d3b5f2/24c1f98b-ea51-4277-9178-ca28a6aa85d9/).

When a runtime group is deleted, all associated entities are also deleted.
This includes all entities configured in the Runtime Manager for this group.
As a best practice, [back up](/konnect/runtime-manager/backup-restore/) a runtime 
group's configuration before deleting it to avoid losing necessary configuration.

Runtime instances that are still active when the group is deleted will not be
terminated, but they will be orphaned. They will continue processing traffic
using the last configuration they received until they are either connected to
a new runtime group or manually shut down.

You cannot delete the default runtime group.

## Runtime instances

A **runtime instance** is a single data plane node with a single instance of
a runtime, such as {{site.base_gateway}}. Runtime instances service traffic for the runtime
group. All runtime instances in one runtime group
must be of the same type. Currently, only {{site.base_gateway}} runtime types are supported.

Kong does not host runtimes. You must provide your own runtime
instances.

The Runtime Manager aims to simplify this process by providing a
script to provision a {{site.base_gateway}} runtime in a Docker container,
eliminating any confusion about initial configuration or setup.

You can also
choose to manually configure runtime instances on the following:
* Linux
* Kubernetes
* AWS
* Azure

See the [runtime instance installation options](/konnect/runtime-manager/runtime-instances/) for more detail.

## Plugins

You can extend {{site.konnect_short_name}} by using plugins. Kong provides a set of standard Lua plugins that get bundled with {{site.konnect_short_name}}. The set of plugins you have access to depends on your installation.

Custom plugins can also be developed by the Kong Community and are supported and maintained by the plugin creators. If they are published on the Kong Plugin Hub, they are called Community or Third-Party plugins.

See the [{{site.konnect_short_name}} plugin ordering documentation](/konnect/reference/plugins/) for more information.
