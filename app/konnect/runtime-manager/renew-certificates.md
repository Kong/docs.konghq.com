title: Renew certificates for a runtime
no_version: true
---

Certificates generated by {{site.konnect_saas}} expire every 30 days.

Renew your certificates to prevent any interruption in communication between
{{site.konnect_saas}} and any configured runtimes.

Depending on your setup, renewing certificates might mean bringing up a new data
plane, or generating new certificates and updating data planes with the new
files.

## Quick setup

1. Stop the data plane container.
2. Open Runtime Manager and click **Configure New Runtime**.
3. Run the script again to
[create a new data plane](/konnect/runtime-manager/kong-gateway-runtime) with
updated certificates.
4. Remove the old data plane container.

## Advanced setup

1. Open Runtime Manager and click **Configure New Runtime**.
2. Click **Generate Certificates**.
3. Save the new certificates and key into separate files:

    * Certificate: `cluster.crt`
    * Private key: `cluster.key`
    * Root CA Certificate: `ca.crt`

4. Replace existing certificates on your data planes with the new files.

5. Restart {{site.base_gateway}} for the settings to take effect:

    ```sh
    $ kong restart
    ```
