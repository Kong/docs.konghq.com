title: Setting up a Kong Gateway Runtime
no_version: true
---
Set up a [runtime](/konnect/overview/#konnect-key-concepts-and-terminology)
through the
[{{site.konnect_short_name}} Runtime Manager](/konnect/runtime-manager) and
configure your {{site.ee_gateway_name}} instance to accept configuration from
{{site.konnect_short_name}}. The Runtime Manager keeps track of all runtimes
associated with the {{site.konnect_short_name}} SaaS account.

As a quick setup option, run a script to provision a {{site.ee_gateway_name}}
instance in a Docker container, with all connection details configured and
certificates automatically applied.

<b>Note:</b> Kong does not host runtimes. You must install and host your own
runtime instances.

## Prerequisites

* You have a {{site.konnect_product_name}} account. Contact your sales
representative for access.
* Tools and permissions:
  * **All platforms:** [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/), and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed
  * **Linux:** User added to the [`docker` group](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)
  * **Windows:** Docker Desktop [installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/#install-docker-desktop-on-windows) and [integrated with a WSL 2 backend](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/wsl/)

## Set up a New Runtime Instance

1. From the left navigation menu, open **Runtimes**.

    For the first runtime, the page opens to a **Configure New Runtime** form.

    Once configured, this page lists all runtimes associated with the
    {{site.konnect_short_name}} SaaS account.

2. (Optional) If this is not the first runtime configuration, click
**Configure New Runtime**.

3. Click **Copy Script**.

    You can expand the codeblock by clicking **Show** to see the entire script.

4. Replace the placeholder for `<your-password>` with your own
{{site.konnect_short_name}} SaaS password.

5. Run the script on any host you choose.

    This script creates a Docker container running a simple
    {{site.ee_gateway_name}} instance and connects it to your
    {{site.konnect_short_name}} SaaS account.

6. Click **Done** to go to the Runtime Manager overview.

    Once the script has finished running, the Runtimes Manager will
    include a new entry for your instance.
    <!-- and the tag in the **Node Status** column should say
    **Connected**.-->

## Access Services using the Proxy URL

The default proxy URL for a runtime generated by this script is
`http://localhost:8000`. Use this URL, along with any Routes you set, to access
your Services.

For example, to access a Service with the Route `/mock`, use
`http://localhost:8000/mock`.

<!-- To change the default URL, see [link TBA].-->
