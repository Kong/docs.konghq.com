### Charts and limitations

{{site.konnect_short_name}} charts offer interactive features such as the ability to hover over elements to reveal additional details, and to filter data by selecting items with the chart. {{site.konnect_short_name}} caps the number of entities showing in any activity graph or [custom reports](/konnect/analytics/use-cases/) to 50. If this limit is exceeded, a warning icon displays at the top of the affected graph or report.

### Data ingestion

Data ingestion is managed from the **Control Plane Dashboard**, using the analytics toggle, which allows you to turn ingestion and data collection on or off for your API traffic within a given control plane.

This feature provides flexibility in managing your data insights and can help you control costs. There are two states: 

* **On**: When analytics is enabled, both basic and advanced data is collected. This gives you valuable insights into API traffic and allows you to generate detailed custom reports.
* **Off**: When you disable analytics, the collection of advanced data stops. However, basic data continues to be collected. This ensures that you still have essential insights and that contextual features in {{site.konnect_short_name}} remain functional.

When analytics is set to **off**, new analytics data for this control plane will not appear in [custom reports](/konnect/analytics/use-cases/) or [API requests](/konnect/analytics/api-requests/), but you will still have access to basic API usage information within the gateway manager.

It is only possible to toggle analytics for the entity your data planes are connected to. If you are using control plane groups, the toggle will only have an effect on the group, not on member CPs.

{:.note}
> **Transition Time**: When you change the toggle for a control plane, it may take a few minutes for the setting to take effect. During this time, you may see partial data in analytics for your data planes.

### Team permissions
