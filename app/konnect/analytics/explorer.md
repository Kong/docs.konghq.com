Explorer is an intuitive web-based interface that displays API usage data gathered by {{site.konnect_short_name}} Analytics from your data plane nodes. You can use this tool to promptly diagnose performance issues, monitor LLM token consumption and costs, or capture essential usage metrics. Explorer also provides the option to save the output as custom reports.

![Explorer Dashboard](/assets/images/products/konnect/analytics/konnect-explorer-dashboard.png){:.image-border}

To begin using Explorer, go to the **Analytics** {% konnect_icon analytics %} section and select [**Explorer**](https://cloud.konghq.com/analytics/explorer). You can select from **API Usage** or **LLM Usage** from the dashboard options.

{% navtab Metrics %}


Traffic metrics provide insight into which of your services are being used and how they are responding. Within a single report, you have the flexibility to choose one or multiple metrics from the same category.

Metric | Category | Description
-------|------------
Request Count | Count | Total number of API calls within the selected time frame. This includes requests that were rejected due to rate limiting, failed authentication, and so on.
Requests per Minute | Rate | Number of API calls per minute within the selected time frame.
Response Latency | Latency | The amount of time, in milliseconds, that it takes to process an API request. Users can select between average (avg) or different percentiles (p99, p95, and p50). For example, a 99th percentile response latency of 10 milliseconds means that every 1 in 100 requests took at least 10 milliseconds from request received until response returned. 
Upstream Latency | Latency | The amount of time, in milliseconds, that {{site.base_gateway}} was waiting for the first byte of the upstream service response. Users can select between different percentiles (p99, p95, and p50). For example, a 99th percentile response latency of 10 milliseconds means that every 1 in 100 requests took at least 10 milliseconds from sending the request to the upstream service until the response returned.
Kong latency | Latency | The amount of time, in milliseconds, that {{site.base_gateway}} was waiting for the first byte of the upstream service response. Users can select between different percentiles (p99, p95, and p50). For example, a 99th percentile response latency of 10 milliseconds means that every 1 in 100 requests took at least 10 milliseconds from the time the {{site.base_gateway}} received the request up to when it sends it back to the upstream service.
Request Size | Size | The size of the request payload received from the client, in bytes. Users can select between different percentiles (p99, p95, and p50). For example, a 99th percentile request size of 100 bytes means that the payload size for every 1 in 100 requests was at least 100 bytes.
Response Size | Size | The size of the response payload returned to the client, in bytes. Users can select between different percentiles (p99, p95, and p50). For example, a 99th percentile response size of 100 bytes means that the payload size for every 1 in 100 response back to the original caller was at least 100 bytes.

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Time intervals %}

The time frame selector controls the time frame of data visualized, which indirectly controls the
granularity of the data. For example, the “5M” selection displays five minutes in
one-second resolution data, while longer time frames display minute, hour, or days resolution data.

All time interval presets are **relative**. This means that time frames are dynamic and the report captures a snapshot of data
relative to when a user views the report.
For custom reports, you can also choose a **custom** date range. Custom means that time frames are static and the report captures a snapshot of data
during the specified time frame. You can see the exact range below
the time frame selector. For example:

    ```
    Jan 26, 2023 12:00 AM - Feb 01, 2023 12:00 AM (PST)
    ```

Interval | Description  
---------|-------------
Last 15 minutes | Data is aggregated in one minute increments.
Last hour| Data is aggregated in one minute increments.
Last six hours | Data is aggregated in one minute increments.
Last 12 hours| Data is aggregated in one hour increments.
Last 24 hours| Data is aggregated in one hour increments.
Last seven days | Data is aggregated in one hour increments.
Last 30 days | Data is aggregated in daily increments.
Current week | Data is aggregated in one hour increments. Logs any traffic in the current calendar week. 
Current month | Data is aggregated in one hour increments. Logs any traffic in the current calendar month. 
Previous week | Data is aggregated in one hour increments. Logs any traffic in the previous calendar week.
Previous month | Data is aggregated in daily increments. Logs any traffic in the previous calendar month.

## LLM usage reporting

Advanced Analytics allows you to monitor and optimize your LLM usage by providing detailed insights into objects such as token consumption, costs, and latency. 

With LLM usage reporting, you can:

* Track token consumption: Monitor the number of tokens processed by the different LLM models you have configured. 
* Understand costs: Gain visibility into the costs associated with your LLM providers. 
* Measure Latency: Analyze the latency involved in processing LLM requests. 

To use this feature, navigate to the [Explorer dashboard](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/analytics/explorer) and switch between API usage and LLM usage using the new dataset dropdown. Metrics and groupings will dynamically adjust based on the selected dataset. 

{:.note}
>**Note**: LLM usage reporting requires {{site.base_gateway}} version 3.8.

## Actions

After customizing a view using Explorer's metrics and filters, you can perform several actions:

* **Save as a Report**: This function creates a new custom report based on your current view, allowing you to revisit these specific insights at a later time.
* **Export as CSV**: If you prefer to analyze your data using other tools, you can download the current view as a CSV file, making it portable and ready for further analysis elsewhere.

## Diagnosing latency issues example

Explorer in {{site.konnect_saas}} gives you the power to monitor your API data in detail and export that data to a CSV file. 
Let's go through an example situation where you could leverage custom reports created in Explorer. With this type of report, you can start exploring which upstream service might cause the latency spike.

One way you can build custom reports is by navigating to {% konnect_icon analytics %} **Analytics** in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} menu, then **Explorer**. This brings you to a page where you can control which analytics data you want to visualize. From here, configure the filter settings as follows:

* **Show**: Line
* **Date/Time**: Last 15 minutes
* **With**: Kong Latency (p95), Upstream Latency (p95)
* **Per**: Minute

Then, you can add a filter to filter by the control plane:

* **Filter By**: Control Plane
* **Choose Operator**: In
* **Filter Value**: prod
