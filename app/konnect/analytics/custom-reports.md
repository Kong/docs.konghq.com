You can do this in a few different ways:

* **Analytics Viewer/Editor role**: Assign stakeholders the Analytics Viewer [role](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/teams-reference) for read-only access or the Analytics Editor role for report customization within the {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization.
* **Screenshots**:  Capture and share screenshots of your reports.
* **Export as CSV**: Export reports to CSV files for integration with external dashboards or visualization tools from the **Reports Actions** drop-down, select **Export Report as CSV**.
