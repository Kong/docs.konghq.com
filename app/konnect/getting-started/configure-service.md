title: Configuring a Service
---

Using the [Service Hub](/konnect/servicehub/), you can create and manage {{site.konnect_short_name}} services. Once you create a service, you can make an API Product for that service. Each API Product consists of at least one
service version, and each API Product version can have one deployment.

![{{site.konnect_short_name}} service diagram](/assets/images/docs/konnect/konnect-services-diagram.png)

For the purpose of this guide, youâ€™ll create a service, add an API Product and version, and
expose the version by creating a deployment pointing to the Mockbin API.
Mockbin is an *echo*-type public website that returns requests back to the
requester as responses.

## Prerequisites

If you're following the {{site.konnect_short_name}} quickstart guide,
make sure you have [configured a runtime](/konnect/getting-started/configure-runtime/).

## Create a service

1. From the left navigation menu, open {% konnect_icon servicehub %} [**Service Hub**](https://cloud.konghq.com/servicehub).

1. Click **New service**.

1. Enter a display name. For this example, enter `example_service`.

    A display name can be any string containing letters, numbers, spaces, or the following
    characters: `.`, `-`, `_`, `~`, or `:`. Spaces are equal to the `-` character.

    For example, you can use `example_service`, `ExampleService`, `Example-Service`, or `Example Service`.
    `Example-Service` and `Example Service` would be considered the same name.

    The display name you create generates a service name. {{site.konnect_short_name}}
    uses the service name for internal metadata.

1. (Optional) Enter a description.

    This description is used in {{site.konnect_short_name}} and on the Dev Portal.

1. Click **Create**.

    You can now see your new service's overview page.

    Now that you have a service set up, you can start filling out details about your
    API.

## Create an API Product version

Let's set up the first version of your API Product.

1. In the {% konnect_icon  %} [**API Products**](https://cloud.konghq.com/apiproducts), click **API Product**.

1. Enter `Example Product` in the **Product Name** field and click **Create**.

1. Open the `Example Product` you just created, and then click **Add** > **New Version**.

1. Enter a version name. For this example, enter `v1`.

    A version name can be any string containing letters, numbers, or characters;
    for example, `1.0.0`, `v1`, or `version#1`. A service can have multiple
    versions.

1. Select a runtime group.

    Choose a [group](/konnect/runtime-manager/runtime-groups/) to
    deploy this API Product version to. This lets you deploy to a specific group of
    runtime instances in a specific environment.

    {:.note}
    > **Note:** Application registration is only available for
    services in the default runtime group, so if you plan on using
    [application registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/application-overview/),
    choose `default` in this step.

    Different versions of the same API Product can run in different runtime groups.
    The version name is unique within a group:

    * If you create multiple versions in the _same group_, they must have unique names.
    * If you create multiple versions in _different groups_, the versions can have the same name.

1. Click **Save**.

## Summary and next steps

In this section, you added a service named `example_service` with the version
`v1`.

Next, go on to [deploy the API Product version](/konnect/getting-started/implement-service/).
