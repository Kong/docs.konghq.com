New to {{site.konnect_saas}}? Get started with the basics:

1.  **Set up a runtime connection**:

    Set up a runtime and connect it to your account. Your first runtime
    connection gives you a data plane for proxying traffic.

    Start with a data plane proxy so that when your service configuration is
    ready, your services are immediately connected, configured,
    and available for testing.

2.  **Create a service**:

    Catalog a new service using the {{site.konnect_short_name}} ServiceHub.

    Using ServiceHub, you can catalog, manage, and track every service in your
    entire architecture. In this step, you create the first version of a service,
    adding the first entry to your catalog.

3.  **Implement the new service**:

    Attach the new {{site.konnect_short_name}} service to an upstream service
    and define a route.

    After you've configured a service and the runtime proxy is ready, testing
    is the next step. Here you set up a route to a mocking API service,
    then proxy traffic through the route.
