title: Get started with Konnect
---

New to {{site.konnect_saas}}? You can get started with the basics by following the steps in the [onboarding wizard in the web app](https://konghq.com/products/kong-konnect/register?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=docs&utm_campaign=gateway-konnect&utm_content=gateway-quickstart-install). 

## What do you want to do first?

Once you've completed the onboarding wizard in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI, you should have a demo service configured as well as a plugin specific to your use case.

Now, you can do one of the following to start adding your own APIs and entities to test {{site.konnect_short_name}}'s capabilities:

<div class="docs-grid-install max-2">

  <a href="/konnect/getting-started/add-api/" class="docs-grid-install-block no-description">
    <img class="install-icon no-image-expand" src="/assets/images/icons/documentation/icn-flag.svg" alt="">
    <div class="install-text">Add my own API to {{site.konnect_short_name}}</div>
  </a>

  <a href="/konnect/getting-started/import/" class="docs-grid-install-block no-description">
    <img class="install-icon no-image-expand" src="/assets/images/icons/documentation/icn-deployment-color.svg" alt="">
    <div class="install-text">Import my {{site.base_gateway}} entities to {{site.konnect_short_name}}</div>
  </a>

</div>
