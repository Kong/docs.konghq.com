title: Get started with Konnect
---

## Quickstart guide

New to {{site.konnect_saas}}? Get started with the basics through the web app:

1. **Create a {{site.konnect_short_name}} account**:

    [Create an account &gt;](/konnect/getting-started/access-account/)

1.  **Set up a runtime instance**:

    Set up your first runtime instance, which gives you a data plane for proxying traffic.

    Start with a data plane proxy so that when your service configuration is
    ready, your services are immediately connected, configured,
    and available for testing.

2.  **Create a Gateway service**:

    Proxy a service using the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Runtime Manager

    After you've configured a service and the runtime proxy is ready, testing
    is the next step. Here you set up a route to a mocking API service,
    then proxy traffic through the route.

3.  **Productize an API**:
    
    Using API Products, you can bundle and manage every service in your
    entire architecture. In this step, you create the first version of a service,
    adding the first entry to your catalog.

## Share APIs and enable development

Ready to share your API with developers?
Use API Products to manage your API product documentation, then publish it to the Dev Portal:

1. **Upload your spec to {{site.konnect_short_name}} and publish to Dev Portal**

    Upload a markdown file to describe your service, and add an OpenAPI spec for any version of the API product.
    Then, publish your API product documentation to the Dev Portal and preview it from the developer perspective.

1. **Register an application**

    Expose your service to developers and register an application
    against the service.
