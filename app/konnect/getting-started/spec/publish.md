title: Publish to the Dev Portal
no_version: true
---

In the previous step of this guide, you created a Service and uploaded docs to it.
Now, publish that documentation to the Dev Portal to share it with developers.

## Prerequisites

* If you're following the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API spec guide,
make sure you have [implemented the Service and started a Gateway runtime](/konnect/getting-started/spec/service/).

## Publish a Service

1. Open the overview page for the Service you created in the previous topic.

1. In the top right corner, click on the **Actions** dropdown and select
**Publish to Portal**.

    By default, this publishes all of the Service's version specs to a private
    Dev Portal site.

## View the published content on Dev Portal

## Summary and next steps

In this topic, you:

* Published the `example_service` documentation to the Dev Portal
* Accessed the Dev Portal, either with a login or through a public link, and checked out the published doc.

Next, [register an application against the Service](/konnect/getting-started/spec/app-registration).
