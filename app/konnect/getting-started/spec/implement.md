title: Implement a Service Version with Kong Gateway
no_version: true
---

Your service is now shared with developers, and they can access the API spec
documentation. Next, you can let your developers interact with the {{site.konnect_short_name}}
service directly by building applications that can consume the service.

To do this, first you need to implement the service to expose it to clients.

## Prerequisites

If you're following the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API spec guide,
make sure you have [imported API docs into {{site.konnect_short_name}}](/konnect/getting-started/spec/service/).

## Implement a Service Version

{% include_cached /md/konnect/implement-service.md %}

## Set up a {{site.base_gateway}} instance

{% include_cached /md/konnect/docker-runtime.md %}

## Verify the Implementation

The default proxy URL for this runtime is `http://localhost:8000`.

Enter the proxy URL into your browser’s address bar and append the route path
you just set. The final URL should look something like this:

```
http://localhost:8000/mock
```

If successful, you should see the homepage for `mockbin.org`. On your Service
Version overview page, you’ll see a record for status code 200. This might
take a few moments.

## Summary and Next Steps

To summarize, in this topic you:

* Implemented the Service version `v1` with the Route `/mock`. This means if an HTTP
request is sent to the {{site.base_gateway}} node and it matches route `/mock`, that
request is sent to `http://mockbin.org`.
* Abstracted a backend/upstream service and put a route of your choice on the
front end, which you can now give to clients to make requests.

Next, [publish your {{site.konnect_short_name}} service to a Dev Portal instance](/konnect/getting-started/spec/publish/).
