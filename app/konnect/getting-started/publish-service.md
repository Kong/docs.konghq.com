title: Publish and Consume Services
---

The Dev Portal is an API catalog that lets you document your {{site.konnect_short_name}} services
and share them with your developers. Developers can use the Dev Portal to
locate, access, consume, and register applications against the services.

This guide walks you through the Dev Portal, viewing any published content, and Dev Portal specific customization options.
## View the published content on Dev Portal

In this section, you can take one of two paths: keep the Dev Portal private
and require a login, or switch it to public, making it visible to anyone with
a link.

If you choose to make the Dev Portal public, application registration
will not be available.

{:.note}
> **Note:** The Dev Portal is a separate site that requires its own credentials.
You can't use your {{site.konnect_short_name}} credentials to log in here.

    You could also [add a custom domain](/konnect/dev-portal/customization/),
    if you have one you want to use.
