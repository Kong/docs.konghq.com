title: Ports and Network Requirements

## Control plane ports

The {{site.konnect_saas}} control plane uses the following port:

| Port      | Protocol  | Description |
|:----------|:----------|:------------|
| `443`    | TCP <br>HTTPS | Cluster communication port for configuration and telemetry data. The {{site.konnect_saas}} control plane uses this port to listen for runtime node connections and to communicate with the runtime nodes. |

Kong's hosted control plane expects traffic on this port, so the cluster port
can't be customized.

The cluster communication port must be accessible by all
the data planes within the same cluster.
This port is protected by mTLS to
ensure end-to-end security and integrity.

## Runtime instance ports

By default, {{site.base_gateway}} listens on the following ports:

| Port                                                                               | Protocol | Description |
|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:---------|:--|
| [`8000`](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#proxy_listen)      | HTTP     | Takes incoming HTTP traffic from consumers, and forwards it to upstream services. |
| [`8443`](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#proxy_listen)      | HTTPS    | Takes incoming HTTPS traffic from consumers, and forwards it to upstream services. |

{{site.base_gateway}} ports can be fully customized. Set them in `kong.conf`.

For Kubernetes or Docker deployments, map ports as needed. For example, if you
want to use port `3001` for the proxy, map `3001:8000`.

## Hostnames

Runtime instances initiate the connection to the {{site.konnect_short_name}} control plane. 
They require access through firewalls to communicate with the control plane.

To let a runtime instances request and receive configuration, and send telemetry data, 
add the following hostnames to the firewall allowlist:

* `cloud.konghq.com`: The {{site.konnect_short_name}} platform.
* `<region>.api.konghq.com`: The {{site.konnect_short_name}} API.
    Necessary if you are using decK in your workflow, decK uses this API to access and apply configurations.
    Region can be `us`, `eu`, or `global`.
* `<runtime-group-id>.<region>.cp0.konghq.com`: Handles configuration for a runtime group.
    Runtime instances connect to this host to receive configuration updates.
    This hostname is unique to each organization and runtime group.
* `<runtime-group-id>.<region>.tp0.konghq.com`: Gathers telemetry data for a runtime group.
    This hostname is unique to each organization and runtime group.

You can find the configuration and telemetry hostnames through the Runtime Manager:

1. Open a runtime group.
2. Click **Add runtime instance**.
3. Choose the Linux or Kubernetes tab and note the hostnames in the code block
for the following parameters:

    ```
    cluster_control_plane = example.us.cp0.konghq.com:443
    cluster_server_name = example.us.cp0.konghq.com
    cluster_telemetry_endpoint = example.us.tp0.konghq.com:443
    cluster_telemetry_server_name = example.us.tp0.konghq.com
    ```
