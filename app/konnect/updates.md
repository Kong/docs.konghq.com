Developers can now configure unique scopes and permissions for each Auth0 DCR application they create, allowing them to set more fine-grained permissions for each of their target audiences. See [Configure Auth0 for Dynamic Client Registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dynamic-client-registration/auth0/) for details.


**Gateway Manager** 
: Navigation within nested entities has been enhanced. Now, any plugin configured for a service, route, or consumer is directly hyperlinked in the configuration. 


## November 2023
**Multi-geo support**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now allows you to host and operate your cloud instance in a geographic region that you specify. This is important for data privacy and regulatory compliance for you organization. Geographic regions allow you to also operate {{site.konnect_saas}} in a similar geo to your users and their infrastructure applications. 

: Geos are distinct deployments of {{site.konnect_short_name}} with objects, such as services and consumers, that are geo-specific. Only authentication, billing, and usage is shared between {{site.konnect_short_name}} geos.

: {{site.konnect_saas}} currently supports the following geos:
  * AU 
  * EU
  * US

: For more information, see [Geographic regions](/konnect/geo/).

**Gateway Manager** 
: The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Gateway Manager has been updated to pull the most accurate data and remain consistent across {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
: Fuzzy filtering is now applied to return more accurate search results on the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Gateway Manager for control planes, gateway services, routes, consumers, and plugins. Fuzzy Filtering is not supported for entities nested within another entity at this time (i.e - Services that belong to a control plane group, routes/plugins from inside a Gateway service, etc.)

* **API consumer**: Allows the Dev Portal developer to register their applications with the consumer services.

: For more information, see [Portal RBAC Setup](/konnect/api/portal-auth/portal-rbac-guide/) and the [Portal RBAC API documentation](/konnect/api/portal-rbac/latest/).

## January 2023

**Dynamic plugin ordering using the UI**
: You can now configure dynamic plugin ordering using the {{site.konnect_short_name}} user interface. Dynamic plugin ordering allows you to override the default static plugin execution order by choosing which plugins run before or after another plugin. 

: **Known limitation:** The control plane can't evaluate any conflicts in the dynamic ordering. If there are any conflicts in the defined order of plugin execution, you will only know during execution via the dataplane logs.

: For more information, see [Plugin Ordering Reference](/konnect/reference/plugins/).

**Consumer groups**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now supports configure consumer groups to enable tier-based API consumption via the {{site.konnect_short_name}} user interface. Consumer groups work with the [Rate Limiting Advanced plugin](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced/) to allow you to manage custom rate limiting configurations for subsets of consumers. With consumer groups, you can define any number of rate limiting tiers and apply them to subsets of consumers instead of managing each consumer individually. Consumer groups are also supported through decK.

: **Known limitation:** There is a rate limiting advanced plugin bug for local strategy where the number of remaining requests resets after every couple of seconds. You can use the Redis strategy as a workaround or if you want to test with local strategy, you can use {{site.base_gateway}} version 3.0.2.0.

: For more information, see [Create Consumer Groups in Konnect](/konnect/gateway-manager/configuration/consumer-groups/).

**Auth0 support for Dynamic Client Registration**
: [Auth0](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dynamic-client-registration/auth0/) is now available as an identity provider for Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

: **Known limitation:** Unlike other DCR providers, Auth0 requires specifying audience, which represents an independent token recipient. Multiple applications can be mapped to one Audience API within auth0 and share the same permissions accordingly.
Currently, our OIDC plugin can only support single audience for this release. We will consider adding support for mutliple audiences in the future iteration.

**Simplified docker script for creating Runtime Instances**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now supports a simplified docker script to create a new runtime instance as well as in the QuickStart which makes it easier to create runtime instances. Instead of downloading a script from github, customers can now use a simple docker run command. This decrease the time and effort taken by customers to launch a Kong Gateway and improves security during runtime instance creation. Runtime Manager also supports simple copy buttons inside the code block components to make it easy for users to copy!

**Curity support for Dynamic Client Registration (GA)**
: [Curity](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dynamic-client-registration/curity/) is now available as an identity provider for Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

: See the [vaults documentation](/konnect/gateway-manager/configuration/vaults/) to get started.

**App Registration Enhancement**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now supports editing the app registration configuration while the app registration is still active. 

**Runtime Groups Configuration API**
: Konnect APIs for [runtime group configuration](/konnect/api/runtime-groups-configuration/latest/) are now available for external consumption. This set of APIs allow organizations to create and manage kong gateway entities and CP/DP certificates. As a result, customers can leverage our APIs to provision runtime groups in their automated pipelines or platform infrastructure while managing data plane connections.

**New {{site.konnect_saas}} Analytics custom report chart types and metrics**
: You can now choose between different chart types when creating custom reports. This feature allows you to better understand traffic patterns, user behavior, or trends over time.

: The new additions include:
* New chart types: You can now select between either horizontal or vertical bar charts, as well as line charts.
* New metrics: You can now measure requests per minute, response latency, response size, and request size as percentiles.
* New time selector: Allows you to use relative time periods, which can help you avoid manually adjusting your reports for weekly reports.

: For more information, see [Generate Reports](/konnect/analytics/generate-reports/).

**Konnect Overview & Service Wizard**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} admins now have an [Overview page](/konnect/) which offers a high-level summary of their entire Konnect platform, news updates, and learning opportunities. In addition, we've added a new Service Wizard to walk admins through the end-to-end process of setting up a Service Package & Service Version, configuring a {{site.base_gateway}}, uploading documentation, and publishing a Service to the developer portal.

**{{site.base_gateway}} 3.1 support**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} users can now use {{site.base_gateway}} 3.1 with {{site.konnect_short_name}}. This allows {{site.konnect_short_name}} users to access the new capabilities and improvements added to {{site.base_gateway}} 3.1 core platforms.

**Support for all {{site.base_gateway}} 3.1 plugins**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} users can now take advantage of the the entire plugin suite offered alongside {{site.base_gateway}} 3.1. For more information about the available plugins. review our [compatibility documentation](/konnect/compatibility/#plugin-compatibility).

**Runtime Groups API**
: Konnect APIs for runtime groups are now available for external consumption. This set of APIs allow organizations to create and manage runtime groups and manage CP/DP certificates. [View API documentation](/konnect/api/runtime-groups/v2/).

## November 2022

**Application registration support in any runtime group**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now officially supports [app registration to services in both default and non-default runtime groups](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/#support-for-any-control-plane). Portal developers can register their applications to consume services proxied through gateway services in both default and non-default runtime groups.

:  Currently, this feature is only available for services being proxied through {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 or later.

**Dev portal Dynamic Client Registration**

: As part of this release, we have improved the UI for DCR to provide a more polished experience for users.

**Certificate management functionality added to the {{site.konnect_saas}} runtime manager**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now allows customers to handle the complexity of creating, storing,
and organizing certificates needed for runtime instances connected to runtime groups in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
This reduces operational complexity for customers while ensuring that security is not compromised.

**New Analytics predefined teams**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now allows you to add users to the Analytics Viewer and Analytics Admin teams. These teams allow you to give users access to only the Analytics section in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. With this release, individual users don't have to be Organization Admins anymore to access all the Analytics capabilities.

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now includes the following predefined Analytics teams:
* Analytics Admin: Users can fully manage all Analytics content, which includes creating, editing, and deleting reports, as well as viewing the analytics summary.
* Analytics Viewer: Users can only view the analytics summary and report data.

: For more information, see [Teams Reference](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/teams-reference/).

**Migration to cloud.konghq.com is completed**
: All active accounts have been migrated from `konnect.konghq.com`
to [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com).
The deprecated environment at `konnect.konghq.com` is no longer available.

**Multiple runtime groups**
: All the runtime groups in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, including default and non-default runtime groups, are eligible for application registration.

**Editing the default runtime group**
: You can now edit the name of the default runtime group.
The group still retains its status as the default group, and can't be deleted.

**Konnect APIs for identity management**
: Konnect APIs for identity management are now available for external consumption. This set of APIs allow organizations to manage users, teams, team memberships, team mappings and role assignments. As a result, customers can leverage our APIs to build custom integrations with their identity provider or ERP systems to manage their users and user’s access to Konnect.

request latency for the P50, P95, and P99 percentiles.
P99 latency data also appears in runtime groups and on service overview pages in the Service Hub.

: This feature is available for runtime instances running {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 or later.

## September 2022

**Analytics custom reports**
: [Analytics custom reports](/konnect/analytics/generate-reports/) are now generally available in {{site.konnect_saas}}. This release focuses on stability and minor usability improvements.

: Custom reporting provides more data insights by allowing you to view data details and export data into a CSV file.

**Runtime groups dashboard**
: In {{site.konnect_saas}}, you now have insights into your [runtime groups usage](/konnect/gateway-manager/#runtime-groups) across all and individual runtime instances. These insights help platform owners to understand the health and performance of each runtime group, which often reflects individual business units in a more federated organization.

**Custom plugin instantiation**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now allows you to discover, configure, and apply Kong approved custom plugins to your control planes directly through the plugin hub in Runtime Manager. You can do this by submitting your custom plugin schemas for approval through the CRE teams. This allows you to expand Kong's functionality in your environment by using custom plugins, while reducing the operational overhead of working with your CRE teams to discover, configure, and apply custom plugins.

**Launch runtimes directly in a cloud provider <span class="badge alpha"></span>**
: You can now create runtime instances in Azure and AWS directly through {{site.konnect_saas}}. This simplifies the operational process for creating the runtime instance in your private cloud for AWS and Azure.

**Support for multiple versions of runtime instances**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now supports running multiple runtime instances versions at the same time with the same control plane configuration. This makes it easier for you to test and validate new runtime instance versions, such as patch, minor, and major upgrades.
This release includes a new user interface that provides information about which runtime instances are incompatible with the current gateway configuration and provides actionable insights into the corrective steps to fix the issue.

**Quick start for new {{site.konnect_saas}} org admins**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now includes an optional quick start that automatically creates a runtime group, service package, and gateway service, applies the CORS plugin, and shows analytics for that service with the click of a button. You can use the quick start to become familiar with the different aspects of {{site.konnect_saas}} via text and call-outs to key documentation throughout the onboarding process.

**Organization Admin (Read Only) predefined team**
: A new predefined team has been introduced in {{site.konnect_saas}}. This team allows you to grant users read-only access to all features and functions in {{site.konnect_saas}}. As always, permissions are additive, so a user in the Organization Admin (Read Only) team may also have write access to various features if they are assigned additional permissions.

**Multi-runtime group app registration support <span class="badge alpha"></span>**
: You can now enable app registration to services in all runtime groups. This feature only supports versions in the non-default runtime group that use {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.

: As part of this release, API key credentials are no longer stored in the Dev Portal. Portal developers will need to store their credentials immediately after creation.

**Dynamic client registration <span class="badge beta"></span>**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} Dev Portal supports integration with Okta for end-to-end client management. This feature is released as a private beta. This feature allows Dev Portal developers to automatically create applications in Okta and receive credentials to access services proxied through {{site.base_gateway}}.

**Service version lifecycle**
: You can identify the [lifecycle stage](/konnect/servicehub/service-versions/#manage-the-service-version-lifecycle) of your APIs and notify Dev Portal developers if a particular API will be deprecated soon.  

**{{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 support**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now supports {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 runtimes.

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} launches generic OIDC support to allow Single-Sign-On (SSO) for platform login. Customers now have the ability to configure a separate OIDC-compliant Identity Provider (IdP) for {{site.konnect_short_name}}. Generic OIDC is an Enterprise feature.

**Personal Access Tokens**

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} users can now generate personal access tokens (PATs). PATs are used as an alternative method of authentication for [decK](/deck/1.14.x/guides/konnect/) commands avoiding the need to use traditional username and passwords.

**AWS Marketplace Listing**

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} Enterprise can now be purchased through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-7zds3oxx3ntjy) or via private contract with your Amazon Web Services account team. This greatly simplifies the procurement process for existing AWS customers.

**DevPortal Custom Domain Progress Indicator**

: We've added an in interactive checklist when configuring a [custom domain](/konnect/dev-portal/customization/#custom-dev-portal-url) for your developer portal. There is now an indicator to help understand if your DNS changes have propagated, and when the SSL certificate has been generated by {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

**Download option to all reports**

: We have introduced an "Export" option to all reports inside the overview page in Vitals. Exporting a report downloads an unpivoted CSV to your local machine that can be used for offline analysis.

## July 2022

**New environment for {{site.konnect_short_name}}**

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} is now available at [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com), which replaces the `konnect.konghq.com` environment. The environment at `konnect.konghq.com` will no longer receive any updates, and will be deprecated in the near future.


: Existing organizations will be automatically upgraded to the new {{site.konnect_short_name}} environment over the next 4-6 weeks. We will be contacting your organization administrator with more details on the upgrade process.

: You can continue using your `konnect.konghq.com` account and wait until we migrate it, or create a new account and [manually migrate configuration to the new account](/konnect/getting-started/import/).

: The minimum supported {{site.base_gateway}} version for this environment is 2.5.0.1.

**Runtime groups**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now manages all runtime configuration through runtime groups, which provide the ability to securely isolate configuration for sets of runtime instances. Essentially, this gives you access to multiple SaaS-managed control planes in one {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization.

: Every organization starts with one `default` runtime group. Additional custom runtime groups are an enterprise-only feature.

: Learn more about runtime groups and managing them through the [Runtime Manager](/konnect/gateway-manager/), or [manage runtime groups with decK](/konnect/gateway-manager/declarative-config/).

: With runtime groups come a few other changes to runtime management for all organizations:
  * Certificate rotation and management:
    * When setting up runtime instances through the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI, certificates are generated in the browser and pushed to the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API.
    * {{site.konnect_short_name}} no longer requires CA certificates for runtime instances.
    * The validity period for runtime instance certificates has been extended from six months to ten years.
  * Reworked Gateway configuration UI:
    * The Shared Config menu is now part of Runtime Manager. Manage your Gateway services, routes, plugins, upstreams, SNIs, and certificates through a runtime group, alongside all of the runtime instances in that group.
  * You can use [labels for categorizing runtime groups](/konnect/reference/labels/).
  Labels are key:value pairs, and are helpful for organizing, searching, and filtering subsets of {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities.

**Teams and roles**
: You can now manage {{site.konnect_short_name}} authorization with [teams and roles](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/).
Existing RBAC roles have been converted to [predefined teams](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/teams-reference/), which are available for all {{site.konnect_short_name}} organizations.

: To manage user access, invite users to {{site.konnect_short_name}} and add them to teams, or assign individual roles to a user.

: With a {{site.konnect_short_name}} Enterprise subscription, you can also [create custom teams](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/manage/) and assign per-entity permissions for each team.

**Declarative configuration management support with decK**
: As of [decK 1.12](https://github.com/Kong/deck/releases), standard decK commands such as `diff`, `sync`, and `dump` support {{site.konnect_short_name}} runtime groups.
: Learn how to use decK with {{site.konnect_short_name}}:
  * [Get started with decK and {{site.konnect_short_name}}](/deck/latest/guides/konnect/)

**Sorting the runtime status table**
: You can now sort the runtime status table in
Runtime Manager by the **Last Seen** or **Sync Status** columns.


## May 2021

**Certificate expiration limit extended**
: The validity period for runtime certificates has been extended from 30 days to
six months.

: To take advantage of the new validity period, bring up new data planes through
the Runtime Manager. For existing instances, [generate new certificates](/konnect/gateway-manager/data-plane-nodes/renew-certificates/).

**{{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus is launched!**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} introduces a
[new plan tier system](https://konghq.com/pricing) for subscriptions.
* **{{site.konnect_product_name}} Free:** Basic features and plugins with a
cloud control plane.
* **{{site.konnect_product_name}} Plus:** A pay-as-you-go, credit card-based
option that provides a simple way for developers or operators on small teams to
quickly start using the services they need right now.
* **{{site.konnect_product_name}} Enterprise**: For organizations that want
to manage all services across their entire organization. {{site.konnect_short_name}}
Enterprise provides connectivity with enterprise-grade security, scalability,
and observability across any cloud, platform, and protocol to help teams build
powerful digital services and experiences.

: If you already have a {{site.konnect_short_name}} or {{site.ee_product_name}}
account and license, this license will roll over seamlessly into the new
{{site.konnect_short_name}} Enterprise tier.

**{{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus free trials**
: When you [sign up for a {{site.konnect_short_name}} account](/konnect/getting-started/access-account/),
you are automatically enrolled into a 30-day {{site.konnect_short_name}}
Plus free trial. You don't need to provide a credit card or any info beyond
the account registration. At the end of the trial, you'll have the choice to
keep the account at the Plus tier or downgrade to Free.

**Billing and plan management**
: You can now [manage your plan subscription](/konnect/account-management/billing/)
for Free and Plus plan tiers directly from the app. {{site.konnect_short_name}}
now includes a Stripe integration, and the process is fully self-serve: choose
your plan, add a card, make payments, all through the {{site.konnect_short_name}}
app and billing portal.

**Self-serve account registration**
: You can now sign up for a {{site.konnect_short_name}} account without an
access code. No more
reaching out to Kong support or sales for access &ndash; just go

to [https://cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com) and try it out!


**Runtime setup improvements**
: Runtime setup for Linux and Kubernetes environments has improved. When you
configure a new runtime, instead of one **Advanced** tab, the Runtime Manager
now has **Linux** and **Kubernetes** tabs. Choose the tab that fits your
environment and copy the configuration parameters directly.

: **Known issues with the Kubernetes tab:**
: * The `image` and `repository` parameters are in the wrong format and
point to a non-existent image. Substitute them with the following:

    ```yaml
    image:
      repository: kong/kong-gateway
      tag: "2.3.2.0-alpine"
    ```
* `cluster_telemetry_endpoint` is missing a space between
the parameter and the value. Add a space to fix the formatting:

    ```yaml
    cluster_telemetry_endpoint: <your-instance-name>.tp.konnect.konghq.com:443
    ```

## March 2021

**Runtime setup improvement**
: Quick setup just got a little bit faster. When configuring a new runtime
through the Runtime Manager, HTTPie is no longer required for the
quick setup script.

## February 2021

**{{site.base_gateway}} 2.3 support**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now supports {{site.base_gateway}} 2.3
runtimes. There is no upgrade path for existing runtimes.
: To use {{site.base_gateway}} 2.3, [re-provision a new runtime](/konnect/gateway-manager/#runtime-instances).

**Advanced runtime configuration**
: You can now configure custom {{site.base_gateway}} data planes through the
Runtime Manager and run gateway instances outside of Docker.

**Logging plugins**
: The full set of {{site.base_gateway}}'s logging plugins is now available
through {{site.konnect_saas}}. This includes:
* [File Log](/hub/kong-inc/file-log/)

* [Kafka Log](/hub/kong-inc/kafka-log/)
* [Loggly](/hub/kong-inc/loggly/)

* [UDP Log](/hub/kong-inc/udp-log/)

**Portal authentication**
: You can now [disable authentication on a Dev Portal](/konnect/dev-portal/access/),
which exposes the Dev Portal publicly to anyone with the link. No one needs to register
for Dev Portal access.
: New application registrations aren't available through a public-facing portal.

**{{site.konnect_product_name}} ({{site.konnect_short_name}}) is now generally available!**
