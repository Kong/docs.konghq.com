## August 2024

**You can now delete the default control plane**
: In {{site.konnect_saas}}, it is now possible to delete the default control plane.

**SAML Login support**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now supports [SAML authentication protocol](/konnect/org-management/sso/) for logging in. SAML is an open standard that allows {{site.konnect_short_name}} to delegate authentication to an identity provider (IdP). You can choose between OIDC or SAML protocols while setting up Single Sign On for your organization.

**General Availability of API Requests**
: Announcing the general availability of [API Requests](/konnect/analytics/api-requests/). API Requests provide detailed records for the requests that are made to your APIs. This information can not only help you understand your consumers better, but also simplifies any initial investigation into errors or performance issues by providing an intuitive web experience that is fully integrated into the rest of your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization.

## July 2024

**New refresh button in Advanced Analytics**
: We've introduced a refresh button on selected analytics pages such as API Requests and Explorer, allowing users to view updated data without triggering a full site reload. This feature also preserves applied filters and provides a more seamless user experience.

**Dedicated Cloud Gateways on Azure <span class="badge alpha"></span>**

: You can now run Dedicated Cloud Gateways on Azure in the following regions: Frankfurt, Ireland, UK South, Virginia, and Washington.

: ![Azure regions](/assets/images/products/konnect/gateway-manager/konnect-azure-cgw.png)
> _You can select Azure from the list of cloud providers when configuring your cluster._

**Multi-portal**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now supports multiple Dev Portals. Users can create multiple Dev Portals with the same functionality to better segment their customers, brands, and API product experiences. For more information, see [Create Dev Portal](/konnect/dev-portal/create-dev-portal).

**Manage control plane analytics data ingestion**
: You can now opt-out from Analytics data ingestion for individual control planes. This allows you to not only control what data is important for Kong to keep, but also manage your overall spending on the Konnect Advanced Analytics app. If you disable analytics for a control plane, the data for that control plane will no longer display as part of the Analytics dashboard.

: You can manage your control plane analytics data ingestion by editing an existing control plane and clicking the **Advanced Analytics** toggle.

## May 2024

**Gateway 3.7 Support**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now supports the latest {{site.base_gateway}} release version of 3.7.
: Additionally, the expression router is fully supported in the {{site.konnect_short_name}}. You can now define your routes via expressions, and perform CRUD operations on them.

: See the [Gateway 3.7.0.0 changelog](/gateway/changelog/#3700) for all changes in the {{site.base_gateway}} release.


**{{site.konnect_short_name}} Konnect Search Enhancements**
: The new {{site.konnect_saas}} search enhancements now allows you to to search across 29 entities in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. The search enhancement is made up of an advanced search syntax coupled with a refreshed search bar in the UI and a [Konnect Search API](/konnect/api/search/latest/). 

: For more information, syntax description and use cases, see the [Konnect Search API](/konnect/api/search/latest/) and the [Konnect Search Guide](/konnect/reference/search/).

## April 2024

**Dedicated Cloud Gateways**

: You can now quickly spin up a dedicated AWS cloud gateway data plane node in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. With a dedicated cloud infrastructure, you control the sizing and deployment locations of the gateway infrastructure and Kong manages the operations of individual instances and the cluster for you. 

: Dedicated Cloud Gateways are the fastest way to configure and create a {{site.base_gateway}} in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. All you have to do is specify the security you want to use and pre-warm the cluster while {{site.konnect_short_name}} handles the cluster creation.

: Dedicated Cloud Gateways also have the following benefits:
* SOC1 compliant out-of-the-box
* {{site.konnect_short_name}} handles gateway upgrades for you
* Supported on the following AWS regions: Sydney, Tokyo, Singapore, Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Ohio, Oregon

: For more information, see [About Cloud Gateways](/konnect/gateway-manager/dedicated-cloud-gateways/).

: ![cloud gateway dashboard](/assets/images/products/konnect/gateway-manager/konnect-control-plane-cloud-gateway.png)
: > _Example of the dedicated cloud gateway dashboard in Gateway Manager. The dashboard displays the total traffic, error rate, and P99 latency. It also displays the top five gateway services and routes by traffic, as well as the plugins and consumers associated with the gateway._

**Improved UI/UX for Plugins**
: We are happy to announce that a polished UI/UX experience for plugins is now available to our customers on Konnect. Required configuration settings are now grouped together, and indicated as required on the forms, improved tooltips and default fields are present on plugin forms, and a "most popular" plugins section is now available.

: ![Improved UI/UX for plugins](/assets/images/products/konnect/changelog/improved-plugins-ui.png)


**Integrated Markdown Renderer**
: You can now take advantage of an integrated markdown editor for API Products in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. This enhancement simplifies documentation updates by enabling you to edit markdown files directly within {{site.konnect_short_name}}. The {{site.konnect_short_name}} interactive markdown renderer supports: 
* Code syntax highlighting for bash, json, go, and js
* Rendering UML diagrams and flowcharts via Mermaid and PlantUML
* Emojis

: ![Interactive editor](/assets/images/products/konnect/changelog/konnect-interactive-markdown.png)

**PKI Cert Mode Improvements**
: Konnect now defaults to PKI Cert mode for CP/DP connections. As a result, you can now specify your own CA certs during the creation of control planes. In addition, you can now upload your own Kong Cluster Cert/Key pairs to sign off using the CA cert that you uploaded, or continue to have Konnect generate Kong Cluster Cert/Key pairs for you. 

## March 2024


**OAS 3.1 Support**
: Konnect and Portal now support OAS 3.1 out of the box. Users can now upload a YAML/JSON version of OAS 3.1 into their API Product version and the specification will be rendered in the spec viewer on both Konnect and Portal. With OAS 3.1, we now support describing the webhooks in your OAS the same way you describe your API paths. The new version of the spec renderer also supports all available theming options as before. 

: OSS Portal users can also take advantage of this component by upgrading to the latest version of `@kong-ui-public/spec-renderer@2.1.1`.

**Refined user experience for Control Plane Groups**
: We've made improvements to refine the end-to-end workflow of Control Plane Groups for our customers. Now, Control Plane Groups are more intuitive, and easier to understand.

**Enhanced error notification**
: Customers now have the ability to view detailed error notifications for their data plane directly within {{site.konnect_short_name}}. The enhanced logging feature categorizes errors for improved clarity, distinguishing between configuration errors, transient configuration reload errors, and general exceptions. This update empowers users to diagnose and resolve CP/DP connection issues more efficiently.

: ![Konnect-error-log](/assets/images/products/konnect/changelog/konnect-error-log.png)

**New Analytics Explorer page**
: You can now explore and visualize analytics data via an easy to use, point-and-click web interface. The [Explorer page](https://cloud.konghq.com/analytics/explorer) allows you to drill-down into data and easily discover how issues may impact your business. For more information, see the [Explorer overview](/konnect/analytics/explorer/).

**Improved Analytics summary dashboard**
: A new version of the Analytics summary dashboard is now available for all {{site.konnect_short_name}} users. This new version displays all analytics information on one page, which allows you to focus on your most critical API usage data.

: ![analytics summary dashboard](/assets/images/products/konnect/changelog/konnect-analytics-summary-dashboard.png)
: > _Example of the improved Analytics summary dashboard that displays total traffic, error rate, P99 latency, total traffic over time, latency breakdown over time, and Kong vs upstream latency over time._

## February 2024


**Download button added the documents UI**
: You can now click the **Download** button to download the markdown file currently being viewed from the documents UI.

**Additional plugin support for consumer groups**
: Along with {{site.base_gateway}} 3.6 support in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, additional plugins are now supported for consumer groups.

: The following plugins can be applied to consumer groups using the Admin API and the Gateway Manager UI:
* [Rate Limiting (OSS)](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting/)
* [Request Termination](/hub/kong-inc/request-termination/)
* [Proxy Cache](/hub/kong-inc/proxy-cache/)
* [Proxy Cache Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/proxy-cache-advanced/)

**Konnect API Products**
: Konnect now supports reusable auth strategies that can be applied to one or more API product versions. Konnect now also supports multiple DCR providers for portal applications. Users can now create separate DCR providers with various Identity Providers and apply them selectively to API Product Versions while still using non-DCR auth strategies for other API product versions. For more information, see [Enable app registration with multiple IdPs](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/#enable-app-registration-with-multiple-idps)

: If you previously configured application registration, you will see your auth configs saved in a new sidebar section under **Dev Portal** called **Application Auth**.


**Enhanced onboarding wizard**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} users can now experience an enhanced onboarding wizard when they sign up for a new {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization. After signing up, you can optionally use the wizard to test a popular {{site.konnect_short_name}} use case: key authentication or rate limiting. This experience starts with a local, Docker-based gateway setup, automatically configures Gateway Manager entities against demo endpoints, and then guides you through a basic workflow that tests gateway functionality.

: For more information about how to get started with {{site.konnect_short_name}}, see the [{{site.konnect_short_name}} Getting Started overview](/konnect/getting-started/).


**Autogenerated YAML and JSON configuration files for {{site.konnect_short_name}}**
: You can now export configuration of core Gateway Manager objects, like services, routes, and plugins, to YAML or JSON. This allows you to import the file to APIOps tooling, like decK.

## January 2023

**Dynamic plugin ordering using the UI**
: You can now configure dynamic plugin ordering using the {{site.konnect_short_name}} user interface. Dynamic plugin ordering allows you to override the default static plugin execution order by choosing which plugins run before or after another plugin. 

: **Known limitation:** The control plane can't evaluate any conflicts in the dynamic ordering. If there are any conflicts in the defined order of plugin execution, you will only know during execution via the dataplane logs.

: For more information, see [Plugin Ordering Reference](/konnect/reference/plugins/).

**Consumer groups**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now supports configure consumer groups to enable tier-based API consumption via the {{site.konnect_short_name}} user interface. Consumer groups work with the [Rate Limiting Advanced plugin](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced/) to allow you to manage custom rate limiting configurations for subsets of consumers. With consumer groups, you can define any number of rate limiting tiers and apply them to subsets of consumers instead of managing each consumer individually. Consumer groups are also supported through decK.

: **Known limitation:** There is a rate limiting advanced plugin bug for local strategy where the number of remaining requests resets after every couple of seconds. You can use the Redis strategy as a workaround or if you want to test with local strategy, you can use {{site.base_gateway}} version 3.0.2.0.

: For more information, see [Create Consumer Groups in Konnect](/konnect/gateway-manager/configuration/consumer-groups/).

**Auth0 support for Dynamic Client Registration**
: [Auth0](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dynamic-client-registration/auth0/) is now available as an identity provider for Dynamic Client Registration (DCR).

: **Known limitation:** Unlike other DCR providers, Auth0 requires specifying audience, which represents an independent token recipient. Multiple applications can be mapped to one Audience API within auth0 and share the same permissions accordingly.
Currently, our OIDC plugin can only support single audience for this release. We will consider adding support for multiple audiences in the future iteration.

**Simplified docker script for creating Runtime Instances**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now supports a simplified docker script to create a new runtime instance as well as in the QuickStart which makes it easier to create runtime instances. Instead of downloading a script from github, customers can now use a simple docker run command. This decrease the time and effort taken by customers to launch a Kong Gateway and improves security during runtime instance creation. Runtime Manager also supports simple copy buttons inside the code block components to make it easy for users to copy!

**Curity support for Dynamic Client Registration (GA)**

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now officially supports [app registration to services in both default and non-default runtime groups](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/#support-for-any-control-plane). Portal developers can register their applications to consume services proxied through gateway services in both default and non-default runtime groups.

:  Currently, this feature is only available for services being proxied through {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 or later.

**Dev portal Dynamic Client Registration**

: As part of this release, we have improved the UI for DCR to provide a more polished experience for users.

**Certificate management functionality added to the {{site.konnect_saas}} runtime manager**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now allows customers to handle the complexity of creating, storing,
and organizing certificates needed for runtime instances connected to runtime groups in {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
This reduces operational complexity for customers while ensuring that security is not compromised.

**New Analytics predefined teams**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now allows you to add users to the Analytics Viewer and Analytics Admin teams. These teams allow you to give users access to only the Analytics section in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. With this release, individual users don't have to be Organization Admins anymore to access all the Analytics capabilities.

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now includes the following predefined Analytics teams:
* Analytics Admin: Users can fully manage all Analytics content, which includes creating, editing, and deleting reports, as well as viewing the analytics summary.
* Analytics Viewer: Users can only view the analytics summary and report data.

: For more information, see [Teams Reference](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/teams-reference/).

**Migration to cloud.konghq.com is completed**
: All active accounts have been migrated from `konnect.konghq.com`
to [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com).
The deprecated environment at `konnect.konghq.com` is no longer available.

**Multiple runtime groups**
: All the runtime groups in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, including default and non-default runtime groups, are eligible for application registration.

**Editing the default runtime group**
: You can now edit the name of the default runtime group.
The group still retains its status as the default group, and can't be deleted.

**Konnect APIs for identity management**
: Konnect APIs for identity management are now available for external consumption. This set of APIs allow organizations to manage users, teams, team memberships, team mappings and role assignments. As a result, customers can leverage our APIs to build custom integrations with their identity provider or ERP systems to manage their users and user’s access to Konnect.
[IdP API documentation](/konnect/api/identity-management/latest/)

## October 2022

**Dynamic client registration <span class="badge beta"></span>**
: Dynamic client registration with Okta is now in public beta.
[Test it out yourself!](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dynamic-client-registration/okta/)

**Latency reporting**
: The Analytics dashboard now includes a [latency tab](/konnect/analytics/), which lets you track
request latency for the P50, P95, and P99 percentiles.
P99 latency data also appears in runtime groups and on service overview pages in the Service Hub.

: This feature is available for runtime instances running {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 or later.

## September 2022

**Analytics custom reports**
: [Analytics custom reports](/konnect/analytics/generate-reports/) are now generally available in {{site.konnect_saas}}. This release focuses on stability and minor usability improvements.

: Custom reporting provides more data insights by allowing you to view data details and export data into a CSV file.

**Runtime groups dashboard**
: In {{site.konnect_saas}}, you now have insights into your [runtime groups usage](/konnect/gateway-manager/#runtime-groups) across all and individual runtime instances. These insights help platform owners to understand the health and performance of each runtime group, which often reflects individual business units in a more federated organization.

**Custom plugin instantiation**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now allows you to discover, configure, and apply Kong approved custom plugins to your control planes directly through the plugin hub in Runtime Manager. You can do this by submitting your custom plugin schemas for approval through the CRE teams. This allows you to expand Kong's functionality in your environment by using custom plugins, while reducing the operational overhead of working with your CRE teams to discover, configure, and apply custom plugins.

**Launch runtimes directly in a cloud provider <span class="badge alpha"></span>**
: You can now create runtime instances in Azure and AWS directly through {{site.konnect_saas}}. This simplifies the operational process for creating the runtime instance in your private cloud for AWS and Azure.

**Support for multiple versions of runtime instances**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now supports running multiple runtime instances versions at the same time with the same control plane configuration. This makes it easier for you to test and validate new runtime instance versions, such as patch, minor, and major upgrades.
This release includes a new user interface that provides information about which runtime instances are incompatible with the current gateway configuration and provides actionable insights into the corrective steps to fix the issue.

**Quick start for new {{site.konnect_saas}} org admins**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now includes an optional quick start that automatically creates a runtime group, service package, and gateway service, applies the CORS plugin, and shows analytics for that service with the click of a button. You can use the quick start to become familiar with the different aspects of {{site.konnect_saas}} via text and call-outs to key documentation throughout the onboarding process.

**Organization Admin (Read Only) predefined team**
: A new predefined team has been introduced in {{site.konnect_saas}}. This team allows you to grant users read-only access to all features and functions in {{site.konnect_saas}}. As always, permissions are additive, so a user in the Organization Admin (Read Only) team may also have write access to various features if they are assigned additional permissions.

**Multi-runtime group app registration support <span class="badge alpha"></span>**
: You can now enable app registration to services in all runtime groups. This feature only supports versions in the non-default runtime group that use {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.

: As part of this release, API key credentials are no longer stored in the Dev Portal. Portal developers will need to store their credentials immediately after creation.

**Dynamic client registration <span class="badge beta"></span>**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} Dev Portal supports integration with Okta for end-to-end client management. This feature is released as a private beta. This feature allows Dev Portal developers to automatically create applications in Okta and receive credentials to access services proxied through {{site.base_gateway}}.

**Service version lifecycle**
: You can identify the [lifecycle stage](/konnect/servicehub/service-versions/#manage-the-service-version-lifecycle) of your APIs and notify Dev Portal developers if a particular API will be deprecated soon.  

**{{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 support**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now supports {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0 runtimes.
You can keep using existing 2.8.x runtimes, or you can upgrade to
3.0.0.0 to take advantage of any new features, updates, and bug fixes.

: With this major release, {{site.base_gateway}} introduces many new features, including:
* Five new plugins, including WebSocket validation support, TLS connection customization, and OpenTelemetry
* A new expression-based router
* Dynamic plugin ordering through declarative configuration
* Slim and UBI Docker images
and much more.

: **3.0.0.0 is a major release**. This means that it contains breaking changes and incompatibilities with 2.x versions.
Review the list of [breaking changes](/gateway/changelog/#breaking-changes-and-deprecations) before upgrading to 3.0.
: In particular, note the following:
* **Changes to regex route path format**: 3.0 has a new router. To make sure your existing routes work in 3.0, add a `~` to any regex routes. Learn more in the [route configuration guide](/gateway/latest/key-concepts/routes/expressions/).
* **Limitations** ({{site.konnect_short_name}} only): [Secrets management](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/secrets-management/) and [consumer groups](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/consumer-groups/) are not yet supported in {{site.konnect_saas}}.


: For all the changes and new features in {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0, see the
[changelog](/gateway/changelog/#3000).

: To use any new features in the release,
[start up a new 3.0.0.0 runtime](/konnect/gateway-manager/data-plane-nodes/upgrade/).

## August 2022

**Generic OIDC**

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} launches generic OIDC support to allow Single-Sign-On (SSO) for platform login. Customers now have the ability to configure a separate OIDC-compliant Identity Provider (IdP) for {{site.konnect_short_name}}. Generic OIDC is an Enterprise feature.

**Personal Access Tokens**

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} users can now generate personal access tokens (PATs). PATs are used as an alternative method of authentication for [decK](/deck/1.14.x/guides/konnect/) commands avoiding the need to use traditional username and passwords.

**AWS Marketplace Listing**

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} Enterprise can now be purchased through the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-7zds3oxx3ntjy) or via private contract with your Amazon Web Services account team. This greatly simplifies the procurement process for existing AWS customers.

**DevPortal Custom Domain Progress Indicator**

: We've added an in interactive checklist when configuring a [custom domain](/konnect/dev-portal/customization/#custom-dev-portal-url) for your developer portal. There is now an indicator to help understand if your DNS changes have propagated, and when the SSL certificate has been generated by {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

**Download option to all reports**

: We have introduced an "Export" option to all reports inside the overview page in Vitals. Exporting a report downloads an unpivoted CSV to your local machine that can be used for offline analysis.

## July 2022

**New environment for {{site.konnect_short_name}}**

: {{site.konnect_short_name}} is now available at [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com), which replaces the `konnect.konghq.com` environment. The environment at `konnect.konghq.com` will no longer receive any updates, and will be deprecated in the near future.


: Existing organizations will be automatically upgraded to the new {{site.konnect_short_name}} environment over the next 4-6 weeks. We will be contacting your organization administrator with more details on the upgrade process.

: You can continue using your `konnect.konghq.com` account and wait until we migrate it, or create a new account and [manually migrate configuration to the new account](/konnect/getting-started/migration/).

: The minimum supported {{site.base_gateway}} version for this environment is 2.5.0.1.

**Runtime groups**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} now manages all runtime configuration through runtime groups, which provide the ability to securely isolate configuration for sets of runtime instances. Essentially, this gives you access to multiple SaaS-managed control planes in one {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization.

: Every organization starts with one `default` runtime group. Additional custom runtime groups are an enterprise-only feature.

: Learn more about runtime groups and managing them through the [Runtime Manager](/konnect/gateway-manager/), or [manage runtime groups with decK](/konnect/gateway-manager/declarative-config/).

: With runtime groups come a few other changes to runtime management for all organizations:
  * Certificate rotation and management:
    * When setting up runtime instances through the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI, certificates are generated in the browser and pushed to the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API.
    * {{site.konnect_short_name}} no longer requires CA certificates for runtime instances.
    * The validity period for runtime instance certificates has been extended from six months to ten years.
  * Reworked Gateway configuration UI:
    * The Shared Config menu is now part of Runtime Manager. Manage your Gateway services, routes, plugins, upstreams, SNIs, and certificates through a runtime group, alongside all of the runtime instances in that group.
  * You can use [labels for categorizing runtime groups](/konnect/reference/labels/).
  Labels are key:value pairs, and are helpful for organizing, searching, and filtering subsets of {{site.konnect_short_name}} entities.

**Teams and roles**
: You can now manage {{site.konnect_short_name}} authorization with [teams and roles](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/).
Existing RBAC roles have been converted to [predefined teams](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/teams-reference/), which are available for all {{site.konnect_short_name}} organizations.

: To manage user access, invite users to {{site.konnect_short_name}} and add them to teams, or assign individual roles to a user.

: With a {{site.konnect_short_name}} Enterprise subscription, you can also [create custom teams](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/manage/) and assign per-entity permissions for each team.

**Declarative configuration management support with decK**
: As of [decK 1.12](https://github.com/Kong/deck/releases), standard decK commands such as `diff`, `sync`, and `dump` support {{site.konnect_short_name}} runtime groups.
: Learn how to use decK with {{site.konnect_short_name}}:
  * [Get started with decK and {{site.konnect_short_name}}](/deck/latest/guides/konnect/)
  * [Import](/konnect/getting-started/import) {{site.base_gateway}} or `konnect.konghq.com` configuration into `cloud.konqhq.com`

**Dev Portal SSO support with your own IdP**
: You can now configure custom identity providers (IdPs) for the Dev Portal.
: See the [SSO documentation](/konnect/dev-portal/customization/#single-sign-on) for more information.

**Simplified custom Dev Portal URL setup**
: SSL certificate generation for custom URLs is now handled by {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

: To set up a custom URL, see the [Dev Portal customization documentation](/konnect/dev-portal/customization/) for more information.

**Vitals metrics and dashboards**
: The Vitals overview dashboard has been reworked for Plus and Enterprise tiers.
The dashboard now provides metrics for services cataloged by Service Hub within a selected time interval.
You can view a graph for each category by clicking **Traffic** or **Errors**, and switching between the two views. Each graph is filterable by time frame.

: In the Service Hub, graphs for services and routes now show data up to the last 30 days.

**Vitals custom reports** <span class="badge alpha"></span>

: Vitals custom reports are now available for Plus and Enterprise tiers.
Through the Vitals menu, you can create custom reports to track API requests for services, routes, and applications.

: Some custom plugin limitations have changed or been removed.
See the latest requirements in the [plugin documentation](/konnect/servicehub/plugins/).

: Custom plugins can't be added directly through the {{site.konnect_saas}} application.
If you have a custom plugin you want to use in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, contact [Kong Support](https://support.konghq.com/).

**Refactored documentation**
: The {{site.konnect_short_name}} documentation has been refactored to match the new {{site.konnect_short_name}} navigation, and generally reworked to provide a better experience for {{site.konnect_short_name}} users. Let us know what you think via [team-docs@konghq.com](mailto:team-docs@konghq.com)!

**Known issues/limitations**
: The `cloud.konghq.com` environment has the following restrictions:
  * Application registration through Dev Portal can only be used with the default runtime group. This restriction will be removed in a future update to {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
  * The following plugins are not supported:
    * OAuth2 Authentication
    * Apache OpenWhisk
    * Vault Auth
    * DeGraphQL
    * GraphQL Rate Limiting Advanced

Redis server. To store counters in-memory on each node, change this setting
to `local`.

: The `cluster` config strategy/policy is not supported in
{{site.konnect_saas}}, and does not appear as an option in the plugin
configuration anymore.

: To find the setting based on the rate limiting plugin, see:
* `config.policy`:
    * [Rate Limiting](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting/)
    * [Response Rate Limiting](/hub/kong-inc/response-ratelimiting/)
* `config.strategy`:
    * [GraphQL Rate Limiting Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/graphql-rate-limiting-advanced/)
    * [Rate Limiting Advanced ](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced/)

**{{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus is launched!**
: {{site.konnect_short_name}} introduces a
[new plan tier system](https://konghq.com/pricing) for subscriptions.
* **{{site.konnect_product_name}} Free:** Basic features and plugins with a
cloud control plane.
* **{{site.konnect_product_name}} Plus:** A pay-as-you-go, credit card-based
option that provides a simple way for developers or operators on small teams to
quickly start using the services they need right now.
* **{{site.konnect_product_name}} Enterprise**: For organizations that want
to manage all services across their entire organization. {{site.konnect_short_name}}
Enterprise provides connectivity with enterprise-grade security, scalability,
and observability across any cloud, platform, and protocol to help teams build
powerful digital services and experiences.

: If you already have a {{site.konnect_short_name}} or {{site.ee_product_name}}
account and license, this license will roll over seamlessly into the new
{{site.konnect_short_name}} Enterprise tier.

**{{site.konnect_short_name}} Plus free trials**
: When you [sign up for a {{site.konnect_short_name}} account](/konnect/getting-started/access-account/),
you are automatically enrolled into a 30-day {{site.konnect_short_name}}
Plus free trial. You don't need to provide a credit card or any info beyond
the account registration. At the end of the trial, you'll have the choice to
keep the account at the Plus tier or downgrade to Free.

**Billing and plan management**
: You can now [manage your plan subscription](/konnect/account-management/billing/)
for Free and Plus plan tiers directly from the app. {{site.konnect_short_name}}
now includes a Stripe integration, and the process is fully self-serve: choose
your plan, add a card, make payments, all through the {{site.konnect_short_name}}
app and billing portal.

**Self-serve account registration**
: You can now sign up for a {{site.konnect_short_name}} account without an
access code. No more
reaching out to Kong support or sales for access &ndash; just go

to [https://cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com) and try it out!


**Runtime setup improvements**
: Runtime setup for Linux and Kubernetes environments has improved. When you
configure a new runtime, instead of one **Advanced** tab, the Runtime Manager
now has **Linux** and **Kubernetes** tabs. Choose the tab that fits your
environment and copy the configuration parameters directly.

: **Known issues with the Kubernetes tab:**
: * The `image` and `repository` parameters are in the wrong format and
point to a non-existent image. Substitute them with the following:

    ```yaml
    image:
      repository: kong/kong-gateway
      tag: "2.3.2.0-alpine"
    ```
* `cluster_telemetry_endpoint` is missing a space between
the parameter and the value. Add a space to fix the formatting:

    ```yaml
    cluster_telemetry_endpoint: <your-instance-name>.tp.konnect.konghq.com:443
    ```

## March 2021

**Runtime setup improvement**
: Quick setup just got a little bit faster. When configuring a new runtime
through the Runtime Manager, HTTPie is no longer required for the
quick setup script.

## February 2021

**{{site.base_gateway}} 2.3 support**
: {{site.konnect_saas}} now supports {{site.base_gateway}} 2.3
runtimes. There is no upgrade path for existing runtimes.
: To use {{site.base_gateway}} 2.3, [re-provision a new runtime](/konnect/gateway-manager/#runtime-instances).

**Advanced runtime configuration**
: You can now configure custom {{site.base_gateway}} data planes through the
Runtime Manager and run gateway instances outside of Docker.

**Logging plugins**
: The full set of {{site.base_gateway}}'s logging plugins is now available
through {{site.konnect_saas}}. This includes:
* [File Log](/hub/kong-inc/file-log/)
* [HTTP Log](/hub/kong-inc/http-log/)
* [Kafka Log](/hub/kong-inc/kafka-log/)
* [Loggly](/hub/kong-inc/loggly/)
