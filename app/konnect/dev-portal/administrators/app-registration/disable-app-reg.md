title: Disable App Registration for a Service
no_version: true
---

Disable application registration for a Service. Disabling application registration
deletes all plugins that were initially enabled for a Service. You cannot manually
delete a plugin that was automatically enabled by app registration, such as the
`acl` and `key-auth` or `openid-connect` plugins that
were automatically enabled in tandem when app registration was enabled.
When app registration is enabled, you cannot disable
those authentication plugins either. If you attempt to do so, a modification not
allowed when application registration message appears. The only way to (indirectly, automatically)
delete the automatically enabled authentication plugins is to disable app registration.
Any other plugins that were enabled manually, such as `rate-limiting`, remain enabled.

The main reason for disabling app registration for a Service is when an API
no longer requires authentication. If you want to disable Auto Approve at the
Service level, disable app registration and then enable it again with the Auto Approve
toggle set to disabled.

You can

again any time at your discretion.
