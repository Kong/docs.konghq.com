title: Auto Approve Developer and Application Registrations
no_version: true
---

When automatic approval is enabled, {{site.konnect_short_name}} admins do not
need to manually manage the requests for
[developer registration](/konnect/dev-portal/administrators/manage-devs)
and [application registration](/konnect/dev-portal/administrators/app-registration/manage-app-reg-requests) approvals.

Auto approve is disabled by default. You can enable and disable approvals at any time.
If there are any pending requests when Auto Approve is enabled, those requests must be manually approved.

Auto approve for application registration can be enabled in two ways:

* On a per-Service basis when [enabling application registration](/konnect/dev-portal/administrators/app-registration/enable-app-reg).
* On a portal-wide basis using the Portal Settings as described in this topic.

If auto approve is enabled through the Portal, it overrides the per Service setting.
