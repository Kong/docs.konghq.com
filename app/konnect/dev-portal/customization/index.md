You can customize the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal in the following ways:
* [Appearance](#appearance)
* [Custom URL](#add-a-custom-dev-portal-domain)
* [Access](/konnect/dev-portal/access/)
* [Single-sign on](#single-sign-on)


## Appearance

The Dev Portal can be customized by those with Admin roles via the Appearance
settings in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Admin UI. To access the Appearance
settings, click {% konnect_icon dev-portal %} **Dev Portal**, then **Appearance**.

Here, you have the ability to modify the following:

* Logos: default logo and favicon
* Home Page Header: welcome message, primary header, and header image
* Colors: background, text, and button colors
* Themes: default theme and dark mode
* Fonts

For details on the requirements for each customizable option, hover over the information (`i`) icon next to each item in the UI.

## Custom Dev Portal URL

All Dev Portals have an auto-generated default Dev Portal URL. You can add a custom domain. When set up properly, users can access the Dev Portal from both the default URL and the custom URL. The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Kong Dev Portal generates an SSL certificate for your custom domain automatically.

### Top-level domains

{{site.konnect_short_name}} offers support for the following top-level domains: 

- `*.io`
- `*.com`
- `*.tech`
- `*.net`
- `*.dev`

### Prerequisites

* A domain and access to configure domain's CNAME
* Your organization's auto-generated default Dev Portal URL. For example, `https://kong121212.portal.konnect.konghq.com/`.

### Direct your CNAME to the default Dev Portal URL

From your domain registrar's DNS records settings options, point your CNAME to your Dev Portal's default URL.

### Add a custom Dev Portal domain

Add a custom Dev Portal domain through your organization's {{site.konnect_short_name}} Admin UI.

1. In {{site.konnect_short_name}}, open {% konnect_icon dev-portal %} **Dev Portal**, then click **Settings**.

2. Open the **Portal URL** tab.

3. Enter the full domain, including subdomain (if applicable). Don't include a path. It's not necessary to include the URL protocol, for example, `https://` into the **Custom Portal URL** field.

4. Test to see if your custom URL works. You'll see the custom URL listed in your Dev Portal under your default Dev Portal URL. Your SSL certificate will be generated automatically.

   {:.note}
   > **Note:** DNS propagation can take a few hours. If after a few hours you can't access the Dev Portal from the custom URL, contact your domain registrar.

## Single Sign-On
{:.badge .enterprise}

A {{site.konnect_short_name}} Admin can configure Single Sign-On (SSO) for the Dev Portal via the Identity settings in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Admin interface.

1. In {{site.konnect_short_name}}, open {% konnect_icon dev-portal %} **Dev Portal**, then click **Settings**.

2. Open the **Identity** tab.

   {:.note}
      > **Note:** Copy the callback URL and enter it in your OIDC Provider

3. Enter the full domain, including the subdomain and protocol, into the  **Provider URL** field (also known as **Issuer**). For example,  `https://accounts.google.com` for Google IdP.

4. Enter the unique identifier provided by the IdP into the **Client ID** field.

5. Enter the secret used to verify ownership of your IdP client into the **Client Secret** field.

### Configuration Requirements

You must always have a form of authentication configured. Built-in and SSO can be used individually or in combination. Each state results in a different user experience, as represented in the following table:

| State | SSO registration | SSO sign in | Built-in registration| Built-in sign in | Information|
| --- | :-----------: |  ----------- | :-----------: | ----------- |
| **SSO: Enabled**<br>**Built-in: Disabled** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | - Developers can register and log in with SSO.<br><br>- Developers registered with Built-in are forced to use SSO.<br><br>- The Built-in authentication window does not display from the Dev Portal. 
| **SSO: Disabled**<br>**Built-in: Enabled** | ❌ | ❌ | ✅  |✅  | - Developers can register and log in with a username and password.| 
| **SSO: Enabled**<br>**Built-in: Enabled** | ✅  | ✅ | ✅  | ✅  | - Developers can register and log in with either form of authentication.|


### OIDC Details

* If a user account associated with a {{site.konnect_short_name}} developer is removed from the IdP, the {{site.konnect_short_name}} developer account is not deleted. A {{site.konnect_short_name}} Admin must delete it from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} dashboard.
* If a {{site.konnect_short_name}} developer associated with an IdP user is deleted, the same IdP user can re-authenticate with the Dev Portal and a new {{site.konnect_short_name}} developer account is created. To persistently revoke access for developers authenticating through your IdP, you must remove the ability for that user to authenticate with the IdP.
* User information from the IdP is not synced with {{site.konnect_short_name}} developers after the first login.
