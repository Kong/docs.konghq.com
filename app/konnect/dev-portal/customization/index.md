The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal currently offers three areas you can customize:
* [Appearance](#appearance)
* [Custom URL](#add-a-custom-dev-portal-domain)
* [Enabling Public Access](/konnect/dev-portal/publish/#access)

This doc covers the details of customizing the appearance of your Developer Portal, and the steps to customize a URL.

## Appearance

The Dev Portal can be customized by those with Admin roles via the Appearance
settings in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Admin UI. To access the Appearance
settings, click {% konnect_icon dev-portal %} **Dev Portal**, then **Appearance**.

Here, you have the ability to modify the following:

* Logos: default logo and fav icon
* Home Page Header: welcome message, primary header, and header image
* Colors: background, text, and button colors
* Themes: default theme and dark mode
* Fonts

For details on the requirements for each customizable option, hover over the information (`i`) icon next to each item in the UI.


## Custom Developer Portal URL

All Dev Portals have an auto-generated default Dev Portal URL. You can add a custom domain. When set up properly, users can access the Dev Portal from both the default URL and the custom URL. The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Kong Developer Portal generates an SSL certificate for your custom domain automatically.

### Prerequisites

* A domain and access to configure domain's CNAME
* Your organization's auto-generated default Dev Portal URL. For example, `https://kong121212.portal.konnect.konghq.com/`.

### Direct your CNAME to the default Dev Portal URL

From your domain registrar's DNS records settings options, point your CNAME to your Dev Portal's default URL.


## Add a custom Dev Portal domain

Add a custom Dev Portal domain through your organization's {{site.konnect_short_name}} Admin UI.

1. In {{site.konnect_short_name}}, open {% konnect_icon dev-portal %} **Dev Portal**, then click **Settings**.

2. Open the **Portal URL** tab.

3. Enter the full domain, including subdomain (if applicable). Don't include a path. It's not necessary to include the URL protocol, for example, `https://` into the **Custom Portal URL** field.

4. Test to see if your custom URL works. You'll see the custom URL listed in your Dev Portal under your default Dev Portal URL. Your SSL certificate will be generated automatically.

   {:.note}
   > **Note:** DNS propagation can take a few hours. If after a few hours you can't access the Dev Portal from the custom URL, contact your domain registrar.
