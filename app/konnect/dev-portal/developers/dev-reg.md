Everyone accessing a {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal needs to register for that specific Dev Portal as a Developer, including Dev Portal admins. This means that admins will have credentials for both [Konnect](https://konnect.konghq.com/) and the Dev Portal. 

All Developer registrations are either automatically or manually approved by {{site.konnect_short_name}} admins.

1. As an admin, log in to [konnect.konghq.com](https://konnect.konghq.com/). 

2. Use the left-side menu to navigate to **Dev Portal**, then **Published Services**. 

3. Under the title heading **Published Services**, click the **Portal URL** link.

4. The **Portal URL** leads to a login page. 

5. At the bottom of the login form, click **Sign Up**. 

6. Fill out the registration form and click **Create Account**. 

7. Check your email for registration confirmation. 

8. Once your email is confirmed, you _will not be able_ to log in until an admin approves your request. However, if the admin has set the Konnect account to [auto approve](/konnect/dev-portal/administrators/auto-approve-devs-apps) developer registrations, you will be able to login immediately. 

9. Once approved, log in using your Portal credentials. Contact your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin if you have login issues.
