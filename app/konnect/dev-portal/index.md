The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal is a customizable website for developers to locate, access, and consume API services. The Dev Portal enables developers to browse and search API documentation, test API endpoints, and manage their own credentials. {{site.konnect_short_name}} offers flexible deployment options to support both internal and external APIs that can be managed from {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

## Dev Portal use cases

You can use the following table to help you determine which Dev Portal configurations are best for your use case:

| You want to... | Then use... |
| -------------- | ----------- |
| Publish APIs to two Dev Portals, one for internal developers and one for external partner developers | [Multi-portal](/konnect/dev-portal/create-dev-portal/) |
| Allow developers to get API keys and start using your APIs | [Enable app reg and Dev Portal](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/) |
| Determine which users can see which APIs in Dev Portal | [Assign different APIs and permissions with RBAC Teams](/konnect/api/portal-auth/portal-rbac-guide/#main) |
| Self-host or visually customize your Dev Portal | [Self-hosted Dev Portal](/konnect/dev-portal/customization/self-hosted-portal/) |
| Publish documentation for your APIs | [Add and publish API product documentation](/konnect/dev-portal/publish-service/) |
| Keep track of Dev Portal authentication, authorization, and access logs in a SIEM provider | [Dev Portal audit logs](/konnect/dev-portal/audit-logging/) |

## Contextual developer application analytics 

You can view analytics for your applications from within the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal. This helps you gain insight into your consumption of different API versions, routes, and methods.

![Contextual developer analytics dashboard](/assets/images/products/konnect/dev-portal/konnect-developer-analytics.png)
> _**Figure 1:** Example developer analytics dashboard_

Each application has its own dashboard, which provides a high-level summary of the **Number of Requests**, **Average Error Rate**, and **p99 Latency**, and charts for the following data points: 

* Requests by version
* P99 latency by version
* Error code distribution 

All of these metrics can be viewed within a selected time frame of up to **30 days**, over a period of the last 90 days.
