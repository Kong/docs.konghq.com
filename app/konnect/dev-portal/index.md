The {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal is a customizable website for developers to locate, access, and consume API services. The Dev Portal enables developers to browse and search API documentation, test API endpoints, and manage their own credentials. {{site.konnect_short_name}} offers flexible deployment options to support both internal and external APIs that can be managed from the same {{site.konnect_short_name}} instance.

## Publish service documentation

In {{site.konnect_short_name}}, services created in the Service Hub can be published to the Dev Portal with one click. Published services become immediately available to users who the Dev Portal. When a service is published, the API spec and any Service Document are viewable. We use the term discoverable here because the Dev Portal can create a unified API experience where a developer can navigate through the different APIs that are available, read documentation, test endpoints within the Dev Portal, and register to create applications using your specific APIs.

* [Getting started guide](/konnect/getting-started/spec/service/): This guide walks you through importing an API spec, implementing service versions, publishing your service and corresponding API spec to the Dev Portal, and configuring registration settings so that users can view your services and register applications.

* [How to publish services to the Dev Portal](/konnect/servicehub/service-documentation/#publishing/): This how-to explains ho* w to publish services to the Dev Portal.

* [How to manage documentation](/konnect/servicehub/service-documentation/): This how-to explains how to perform all of the functionality related to managing API specs and service descriptions. Service descriptions are markdown files that explain the aspects of your API, like a README.  

The Dev Portal lives at a separate URL from {{site.konnect_short_name}} and requires that all users, including Admin roles, [register as a Developer](/konnect/dev-portal/dev-reg/).

## Developer self service

Dev Portals are created for developers to use. The Dev Portal removes the burden of credential management from the API creator, and empowers developers to manage that aspect of the application development lifecycle on their own. When developers register their application to interact with services that have been exposed through Service Hub, they will have access to an overview page for the application that they registered, on this page, they can manage their API keys. Developers can also unregister for specific services independently.
