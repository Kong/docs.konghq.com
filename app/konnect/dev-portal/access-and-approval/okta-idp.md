badge: enterprise

You can set up single sign-on (SSO) access to Dev Portals through Okta using OpenID Connect or SAML. 
These authentication methods allow developers to log in to a Dev Portal using their Okta credentials 
without needing a separate {{site.konnect_saas}} login. 

{:.note}
> This page provides specific instructions for configuring SSO with Okta. 
See [Configure Generic SSO](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/sso/) for general instructions on setting up SSO for other identity providers.
