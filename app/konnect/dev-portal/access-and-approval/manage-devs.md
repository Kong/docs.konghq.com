From the **Connections** menu, you can manage developers and developer registration requests to
access the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal. The **Connections** section contains three pages to help you manage different aspects of the Dev Portal:
* From the **Requests** page, you can manage developer and application registration requests.
* By clicking the **Developers** menu, you can manage access to your Dev Portal for individual developers.
* The **Applications** menu lists applications and their statuses.

To allow automatic approval of developer registration requests,
enable [auto approve](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/auto-approve-devs-apps).

## Requests page

The **Requests** page is available by clicking the **Connections** tab from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} navigation menu. On the **Requests** page, you can manage registration requests for developers with the **Developers** tab, and applications with the **Applications** tab.


From the Developers tab, you can:

- [Approve a developer request for access.](#approve-dev-reg)
- [Reject a developer request for access.](#reject-dev-reg)
- [Delete a developer request for access.](#delete-dev-reg)
- [Approve a request for app registration with a Service.](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-app-reg-requests/#approve-app-reg)
- [Reject a request for app registration with a Service.](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-app-reg-requests/#reject-app-reg)
- [Delete a request for app registration with a Service.](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-app-reg-requests/#delete-app-reg)
- Search for a developer who has requested access.

If there are no pending requests, a `No Developer Requests` message is displayed. The number of
pending requests is displayed in the Developers tab. See our list of [all available statuses](#status).

2.  Click the {% konnect_icon cogwheel %} icon then choose
   **Approve** from the context menu.

### Reject access request {#reject-dev-reg}
You can to reject a developer's request to register for your Dev Portal. Rejecting a developer will prevent them from accessing the Dev Portal. You can reject an access request from the **Developers** tab:

A developer whose request was rejected will have to use a different email address to register for the Dev Portal.
If a rejected request is deleted, the developer can register
again with the same email address.
