title: Developer Registration

Anyone accessing a {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal needs to register as a Developer for that specific Dev Portal, including {{site.konnect_short_name}} admins. This means that admins will have separate credentials for [Konnect](https://cloud.konghq.com/) and the Dev Portal.

All Developer registrations are either automatically or manually approved by {{site.konnect_short_name}} service admins and organization admins. For instructions on registering as a Developer, see [Register as a Developer](#register-as-a-developer).

## Locate Dev Portal URL

Admins can find the Dev Portal URL in [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com/). If you don't have admin access and want to register as a Developer, ask your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin for the Dev Portal URL.

{:.note}
> **Note**: If you are an admin planning to create Applications and register Services, you must also [Register as a Developer](#register-as-a-developer).

1. As an admin, log in to [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com/). 

2. Use the left-side menu to navigate to **Dev Portal**, then **Published Services**.

3. Under the title heading **Published Services**, see the **Portal URL** link.

## Register as a Developer

All Developers must register through the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal. As each Dev Portal has a unique URL, reach out to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin for the URL you should access.

1. Navigate to the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal URL provided by your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin.

2. At the bottom of the login form, click **Sign Up**.

3. Fill out the registration form and click **Create Account**. 

   You should receive an email to confirm your email address. Click the verification link in the email.

5. Set a password for your account.

    After you have confirmed your email address and set a password, you’ll be able to log into the Dev Portal once your account admin has approved your request. 

## Registration Approval

If your admin has auto-approve enabled, you can log into the Dev Portal immediately after setting a password. Learn how to [set up auto-approval for developer access as an admin](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/auto-approve-devs-apps/).

If auto-approve is not enabled, an admin has to review and approve your request manually. All manually approved developers are notified via email upon gaining access to the Dev Portal. Learn how to [manually approve developer access as an admin](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-devs/#approve-dev-reg).

## Account Management

If you attempt to register multiple times with the same email address, you’ll receive an email with the status of your registration. [Possible statuses](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-devs/#developer-status)) are: `Pending`, `Rejected`, `Revoked`, and `Approved`.

If you forget your password, click on "Forgot your password?" and enter the email address associated with your Dev Portal account. If an account exists with the email address provided, you’ll receive an email prompting you to change your password.

Contact your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin if you have login issues.
