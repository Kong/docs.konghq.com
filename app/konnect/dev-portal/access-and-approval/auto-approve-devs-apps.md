title: Auto Approve Developer and Application Registrations
no_version: true
---

When auto approval is enabled, {{site.konnect_short_name}} admins don't
need to manually approve Developer and Application requests.

If auto approve is not enabled for Developers or Applications, admins will need to approve new Developers and Applications manually. For more information on manual approval, see [Manage Developer Access](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-devs/) and [Manage Application Registration Requests](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/manage-app-reg-requests/).

{:.note}
> If auto approve is enabled through the Portal for Applications, it overrides the Service setting.

## Prerequisites
You have the **Organization Admin** or **Portal Admin** role in {{site.konnect_saas}}.

## Enable or disable auto approve

Auto approve is disabled by default. You can enable and disable approvals at any time. If there are any pending requests when auto approve is enabled, those requests must be manually approved.

1. Toggle to enable or disable auto approve for one or both options:
      * Auto Approve Developers
      * Auto Approve Applications

1. Click **Save**.
