## Manage developer application registration requests

When a developer [registers an application with an API product](/konnect/dev-portal/register-and-create-app),
the requests must be approved by an admin if
[auto approve](/konnect/dev-portal/create-dev-portal/) isn't enabled. When
[application registration is enabled](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg),
developers must register their applications with an API product. You can manage developer application registration requests from the **App Registration Requests** tab on the **Overview** page of your Dev Portal in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. On this page, you can approve, reject, or delete an app request.

{:.important}
> **Important:** Deleting an application request does not prevent a user from creating a registration request for the same application.
To prevent a user from submitting requests, you must revoke access <!-- revoke access to the API product? -->.

## Manage approved application connections to APIs

When a developer
[registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-apps) request is approved, it creates a connection between
the developer, their applications, and any associated API product versions. You can manage application registrations from the **Applications** page of your Dev Portal in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. 

In this section you can: 

- Search for existing applications.
- View details of an application, such as its name, developer, creation date, and description.
- Access connection details for an application.
- Revoke, reinstate, or delete a connection to an API product version from the **Connections** pane.
