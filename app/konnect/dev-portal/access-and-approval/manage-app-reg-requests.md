title: Manage Application Registration Requests
content_type: how-to

When a developer [registers an application with an API product](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-reg-app-service/),
the requests must be approved by an admin if
[auto approve](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/auto-approve-devs-apps) is not enabled. When
[application registration is enabled](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg),
developers must register their applications with an API product. This guide explains different options available to you from the **Requests** page that is available through the {% konnect_icon dev-portal %} **Dev Portal** section.

## Approve a Request {#approve-app-reg}

From the **Requests** page, the **App Registrations** tab is for managing developer's requests to register an application with an API product, any pending application requests are
displayed here.
To manage an application registration request:

* In the row for an application request you want to approve, click the {% konnect_icon cogwheel %} icon, then select **Approve** from the context menu.

The status is updated from **Pending** to **Approved**. The application moves
from the **App Registrations** tab to the **Applications** page.

An email is sent to the developer to let them know their application to register
for a product was approved. In the Dev Portal, the status for the request
is also updated in the **My Apps** pane of the
[application details](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-apps#app-details-page) page.

If there are no pending requests, the **No app registration requests** message is displayed.

## Reject a Request {#reject-app-reg}

An application registration request that
is rejected requires the developer submit another request after
unregistering their application from a product.

From the **App Registrations** tab, reject an application registration request:


* In the row for an application request you want to reject, click the {% konnect_icon cogwheel %} icon, then select **Reject** from the context menu.

The status is updated to **Rejected**. You can
let the rejected request remain on the Requests page
[delete](#delete-app-reg) it.


## Delete an application registration request {#delete-app-reg}

From the **App Registrations**, delete an application registration request:

* In the row for the application registration request you want to delete, click the {% konnect_icon cogwheel %} icon and select
   **Delete** from the context menu.

The request is deleted from the **App Registrations** tab. The pending request is also
deleted from the **My Apps** pane of an application in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal.

 Any pending application requests are displayed in the **Access Requests** page **App Registrations** tab.

{:.important}
> **Important:** Deleting an application request does not prevent a user from creating a registration request for the same application.
To prevent a user from submitting requests, you must [revoke](#revoke-dev-access) access.

## Application registration status {#status}

The following status conditions reflect the current state of a registration request:

**Approved**
: An application created by a developer has been approved to access an API product in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal.

**Pending**
: A developer who has requested access to an API product, but has not
yet had their request reviewed by a {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin. 

**Rejected**
: An application registration request was rejected by a {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin.
