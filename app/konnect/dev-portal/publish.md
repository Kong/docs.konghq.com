title: Publish a Service to the Dev Portal
no_version: true
---

Through ServiceHub, you can publish any Service in your catalog and its
documentation to the Developer Portal. Publishing services to the Developer Portal is the only way to expose your service to Developers. Once the Developer Portal is published and available to Developers, they can apply for access by [registering](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/dev-reg/) a Developer Account. You can also [manage](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-devs/) access to the Developer Portal from the Konnect Cloud interface.
