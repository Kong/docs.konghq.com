## How to find the Dev Portal URL {#locate}

Admins can find the Dev Portal URL in [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com/). If you don't have admin access and want to register as a Developer, ask your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin for the Dev Portal URL.

{:.note}

1. As an admin, log in to [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com/). 

2. Use the left-side menu to navigate to **Dev Portal**, then **Published Services**.

3. Under the title heading **Published Services**, see the **Portal URL** link.
