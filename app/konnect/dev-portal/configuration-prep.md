title: Dev Portal configuration preparation
content_type: concept

It's helpful to know which Dev Portal settings you need to configure based on your use cases before you go through the steps to configure your Dev Portal or Dev Portals. 

There are a few questions to consider before you create your Dev Portal:

* What is your Dev Portal for? 
    * An internal company catalog for APIs?
    * A public API catalog so other companies and developers can use your APIs to create apps?
    * Both an internal catalog for engineers in your company with APIs still in beta as well as a public catalog with APIs that are GA?
* Who will be using your Dev Portal?
    * Internal developers?
    * External developers?
    * Both internal and external developers?
* How will you manage apps created by developers, if any?
    * Do you want to automatically approve all apps?
    * Do you want to manually approve apps?
    * What type of authentication do you want to require for apps?

Use the following diagram to help you determine which Dev Portal settings you'll need to configure:
