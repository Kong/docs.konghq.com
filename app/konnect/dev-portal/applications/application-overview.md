The purpose of registering services to an application is to consume those services using application-level authentication. An application can register multiple services, provided they use the same authentication strategy. Grouping authentication enables direct access to multiple services. The application can host multiple credentials or API keys. For more information about application credentials, refer to [Generate Credentials for an Application](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-gen-creds/).

In the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal, an application's associated services are displayed on its details page. To view all applications linked to your account, select **My Apps** from the dropdown menu beneath your login email in the Dev Portal.

In [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com), admins can access a list of the installed authentication plugins via the **Gateway Manager**. See [Enable Application Registration for a Service](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/) for more information about authentication flows.

Once a developer is [granted access](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-devs/) to the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal, they can create, edit, and delete applications. These modifications are all managed on the **My Apps** page. **My Apps** allows you to view all of your registered applications. Clicking on individual applications from this page opens a detailed overview of an application.

You can perform the following actions from an application's details page:

- [Edit](#edit-an-application) the name, reference ID, and description of an application.
- [Generate or delete credentials](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-gen-creds/).
- View a catalog of services that can be [registered with the application](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-apps), if no services are registered yet.
- View the status of an application registration to an API product.
- Open the analytics dashboard and view metrics about an application.
