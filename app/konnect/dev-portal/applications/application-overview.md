Multiple Services can be registered to a single Application. In the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal, Services registered to an Application will be listed in the Application detail page, available through **My Apps** in the top-right corner dropdown menu beneath the Developer's login email.

The purpose of registering Services to an Application is to consume those Services using the Application-level authentication. Grouping authentication enables direct access to multiple Services. The Application can have multiple credentials, or API keys. For more information about Application Credentials, refer to [Generate Credentials for an Application](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-gen-creds/).

In [cloud.konghq.com](https://cloud.konghq.com), admins can access a list of the installed authentication plugins via **Shared Config**. See [Enable Application Registration for a Service](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/) for more information about authentication flows.

Once a developer is [granted access](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/manage-devs/) to the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal, they will be able to create, edit, and delete applications. These modifications are all managed on the **My Apps** page. The **My Apps** allows you to view all of the registered applications. Clicking on individual applications from this page opens a detailed overview of an application. You can do the following through the application details page:

- [Edit](#edit-an-application) the name, reference ID, and description of an application.
- [Generate or delete credentials](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/dev-gen-creds).
- View a catalog of Services that can be [registered with the application](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-reg-app-service), if no Services are registered yet.
- View the status of an application registration to a Service.
