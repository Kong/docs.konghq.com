To register applications on your Dev Portal, [application registration must be enabled](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/),for a Service by a {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin. All applications must be approved by a {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin, unless [auto approve](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/auto-approve-devs-apps) is enabled. 
## Register an Application

From the Dev Portal, a developer can register for multiple applicable services. To apply to register an Application to a Service, a developer must have a Dev Portal account.

1. Click your email address in the top right corner of the manager and select **My Apps**. 

2. Select the application you want to register. 

3. In the **Services** pane, click **View the catalog**. 

4. Select a Service. 

5. Click **Register**, and from the pop-up modal, then click **Request Access**.
   
You will be notified by email if your Application is approved.
You can check the status of your request in the [application details](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-apps/#app-details-page) page.

## Unregister an Application

You can unregister an application with a pending, approved, or rejected registration status.
Unregistering a pending request removes the request from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin's
approval queue. If a {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin deletes the pending request, the pending request is removed from
the **Services** pane.

1. Click your email address in the top right corner of the manager and select **My Apps**. 

2. Select the application you want to unregister.

3. In the **Services** pane, click the {% konnect_icon cogwheel %} icon for the Service and choose **Unregister**.
