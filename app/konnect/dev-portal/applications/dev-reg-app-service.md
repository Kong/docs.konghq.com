Dev Portal users can request to use {{site.konnect_short_name}} services with their application by submitting an application registration request. All registration requests go through an approval process. A {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin can manually approve requests, or enable [auto approve](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/auto-approve-devs-apps) and have all application requests be automatically approved. 

## Register an application

From the Dev Portal, you can register your application to multiple services. These actions are performed from the **My Apps** section of the Dev Portal.
To register an application, select the **My Apps** option by clicking the drop-down menu below your email address in the Dev Portal, then follow these instructions: 

1. Select the application you want to register. 

2. From the **Services** pane, click **View the catalog**. 

3. Select a service. 

4. Click **Register**, then click **Request Access**.
   
You will be notified by email if your application is approved.
You can check the status of your request in the [application details](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-apps/#app-details-page) page.

## Unregister an application

You can unregister an application that has a pending, approved, or rejected registration status.
Unregistering a pending request removes the request from the
approval queue. If a {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin deletes the pending request, the pending request is removed from
the **Services** pane. 

To unregister an application, navigate to the **My Apps** section of the Dev Portal, and follow these steps: 

1. Select the application you want to unregister.

2. In the **Services** pane, click the {% konnect_icon cogwheel %} icon for the service, then select **Unregister**.
