The Dev Portal removes the burden of credential management from the API creator, and empowers developers to manage that aspect of the application development lifecycle on their own. From the Dev Portal, a user can generate API credentials to use with their applications. 

## Generate a credential

A credential, or API key, generated in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal is a 32-character string associated with an application. An application can have multiple credentials.
To generate an API key from the Dev Portal, navigate to the **My Apps** page, then follow these steps: 

1. Click the application that you want to generate a credential for.

2. In the **Authentication** pane, click **Generate Credential**.

## Delete a credential

You can permanently delete an API key. Once deleted, the credential cannot be restored. 
To delete an existing credential from the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal, navigate to the **My Apps** section of the Dev Portal, then follow these steps: 

1. Select the application that you want to delete a credential for.

2. From the **Authentication** pane, click the icon of the credential you want to permanently delete, then click **Delete**.
