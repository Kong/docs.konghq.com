---


## Prerequisites

* Enterprise {{site.konnect_short_name}} account.
* An [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/)

{:.note}
> **Note:** When using Auth0 DCR for Dev Portal, each application in Auth0 will have the following metadata. This can be viewed via the auth0 dashboard, or accessed from the Auth0 API.
> 
> * `konnect_portal_id`: ID of the Portal the application belongs to
> * `konnect_developer_id`: ID of the developer in the Dev Portal that this application belongs to
> * `konnect_org_id`: ID of the Konnect Organization the application belongs to
> * `konnect_application_id`: ID of the application in the Dev Portal

## Configure Auth0

To use dynamic client registration (DCR) with Auth0 as the identity provider (IdP), there are two important configurations to prepare in Auth0. First, you must authorize an Auth0 application so {{site.konnect_short_name}} can use the Auth0 Management API on your behalf. Next, you will create an API audience that {{site.konnect_short_name}} applications will be granted access to.

To get started configuring Auth0, log in to your Auth0 dashboard and complete the following:

### Configure access to the Auth0 Management API

{{site.konnect_short_name}} will use a client ID and secret from an Auth0 application that has been authorized to perform specific actions in the Auth0 Management API.

1. From the sidebar, select **Applications > Applications**

2. Click the **Create Application** button

3. Give the application a memorable name, like "{{site.konnect_short_name}} Portal DCR Admin"

4. Select the application type **Machine to Machine Applications** and click **create**

5. Authorize the application to access the **Auth0 Management API** by selecting it from the dropdown. It will have a URL of the pattern `https://AUTH0_TENANT_SUBDOMAIN.REGION.auth0.com/api/v2/`

6. In the **Permissions** section, ensure you have selected the following permissions to be granted and click **authorize**:
   * `read:client_grants`
   * `create:client_grants`
   * `delete:client_grants`
   * `update:client_grants`
   * `read:clients`
   * `create:clients`
   * `delete:clients`
   * `update:clients`
   * `update:client_keys`
  
   {:.note}
   > **Note:** If you’re using Developer Managed Scopes, add `read:resource_servers` to the permissions for your initial client application.

7. On the application's page, visit the **Settings** tab and note where you can view the values for **Client ID** and **Client Secret**, which you will use in a later step.

### Configure the API audience

{:.note}
> **Note:** You can use an existing API entity if there is one already defined in Auth0 that represents the audience you are/will be serving with {{site.konnect_short_name}}  Dev Portal applications.
In most cases, it is a good idea to create a new API that is specific to your Konnect Portal applications.

To create a new API audience:

1. From the sidebar, select **Applications > APIs**

2. Click the **Create API** button

3. Give the API a **name**, like "{{site.konnect_short_name}} Portal Applications"

4. Set the **identifier** to a value that represents the audience the API is serving

5. Click **create**

6. Note the **identifier** value used above, which is also known as the **audience**, as it will be used as the **Client Audience** value in {{site.konnect_short_name}}

## Configure the Dev Portal

Once you have Auth0 configured, you can configure the Dev Portal to use Auth0 for Dynamic Client Registration (DCR). This process involves two steps: creating the DCR provider and establishing the authentication strategy. DCR providers are designed to be reusable configurations. This means once you’ve configured the Auth0 DCR provider, it can be utilized across multiple authentication strategies without needing to be set up again.

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Konnect UI %}

1. Sign in to {{site.konnect_short_name}}, then select {% konnect_icon dev-portal %} **Dev Portal** from the menu.

2. Navigate to **Application Auth** to access the authentication settings for your API products.

3. Open **DCR providers** to view all configured DCR providers.

4. Select **New DCR provider** to create an Auth0 configuration. Provide a name for internal use in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. The name and provider type information will not be exposed to Dev Portal developers.

5. Input the **Issuer URL** of your Auth0 tenant, formatted as: `https://AUTH0_TENANT_SUBDOMAIN.us.auth0.com`.  Do not include a forward slash at the end of the URL.

   {:.note}
   > **Note:** You can find the value for your `AUTH0_TENANT_SUBDOMAIN` by checking the **Tenant Name** under **Settings** > **General**.

6. Choose Auth0 as the **Provider Type**.

7. Input the Client ID of the previously created admin application in Auth0 into the **Initial Client ID** field. input the Client Secret of the same Auth0 admin application into the Initial Client Secret field. **The Initial client secret will be stored in isolated, encrypted storage and will not be readable through any Konnect API.**

8. Enter the **Client Audience** as the identifier value you set when configuring the API entity above.

9. **Optional**: If you are using developer-managed scopes, select the **Use Developer Managed Scopes** checkbox.

10. Save the DCR provider. You should now see it in the list of DCR providers.

11. Click the **Auth Strategy** tab to see all of the auth strategies. Select **New Auth Strategy** to create an auth strategy that uses the DCR provider you created.

12. Enter a name for internal use in {{site.konnect_short_name}} and a display name that will be displayed in Dev Portal. In the **Auth Type** dropdown menu select DCR. In the **DCR provider** dropdown, select the name of the DCR provider config you created. Your **Issuer URL** will be prepopulated with the Issuer URL you added to the DCR provider.

13. Enter the mandatory `openid` scope into the **Scopes** field in addition to any other scopes your developers may need access to (for example, `openid, read:account_information, write:account_information`). If you’re using developer-managed scopes, these are the scopes your developers will be able to _choose_ from in Dev Portal.

14. Enter `azp` into the **Credential Claims** field, which will match the client ID of each Auth0 application

15. Enter the value audience field of your associated Auth0 API in the **Audience** field. If you’re using developer managed scopes, scopes selected by the developer should be in this audience.

16. Choose the required **Auth Methods** (`client_credentials`, `bearer`, `session`) and **save**.
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab API %} 

1. Start by creating the DCR provider. Send a `POST` request to the [`dcr-providers`](/konnect/api/application-auth-strategies/latest/#/DCR%20Providers/create-dcr-provider) endpoint with your DCR configuration details:
```sh
   curl --request POST \
   --url https://us.api.konghq.com/v2/dcr-providers \
   --header 'Authorization: $KPAT' \
   --header 'content-type: application/json' \
   --data '{
   "name": "Auth0 DCR Provider",
   "provider_type": "auth0",
   "issuer": "https://my-issuer.auth0.com/api/v2/",
   "dcr_config": {
      "initial_client_id": "abc123",
      "initial_client_secret": "abc123xyz098!",
      "initial_client_audience": "https://my-custom-domain.com/api/v2/"
   }
   }'
```
You will receive a response that includes a `dcr_provider` object similar to the following:

   ```sh
   {
      "created_at": "2024-02-29T23:38:00.861Z",
      "updated_at": "2024-02-29T23:38:00.861Z",
      "id": "93f8380e-7798-4566-99e3-2edf2b57d289",
      "name": "Auth0 DCR Provider",
      "provider_type": "auth0",
      "issuer": "https://my-issuer.auth0.com/api/v2/",
      "dcr_config": {
         "initial_client_id": "abc123",
         "initial_client_audience": "https://my-custom-domain.com/api/v2/"
      },
      "active": false
   }

   ```
Save the `id` value for creating the authentication strategy.

2. With the `dcr_id` obtained from the first step, create an authentication strategy. Send a `POST` request to the [`create-auth-stratgies`](/konnect/api/application-auth-strategies/latest/#/App%20Auth%20Strategies/create-app-auth-strategy) endpoint describing an authentication strategy: 

   ```sh
   curl --request POST \
   --url https://us.api.konghq.com/v2/application-auth-strategies \
   --header 'Authorization: $KPAT' \
   --header 'content-type: application/json' \
   --data '{
   "name": "Auth0 Auth",
   "display_name": "Auth0 Auth",
   "strategy_type": "openid_connect",
   "configs": {
      "openid-connect": {
         "issuer": "https://my-issuer.auth0.com/api/v2/",
         "credential_claim": [
         "client_id"
         ],
         "scopes": [
         "openid",
         "email"
         ],
         "auth_methods": [
         "client_credentials",
         "bearer"
         ]
      }
   },
   "dcr_provider_id": "93f8380e-7798-4566-99e3-2edf2b57d289"
   }'
```

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
## Create an application with DCR

From the **My Apps** page in the Dev Portal, follow these instructions:

1. Click **New App**.

2. Fill out the **Create New Application** form with your application name, authentication strategy, and description.

3. Click **Create** to save your application.

4. After your application is created, you will see the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.
   Store these values, they will only be shown once.

5. Click **Proceed** to continue to the application's details page.

## Make a successful request

In the previous steps, you obtained the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. To authorize the request, you must attach this client secret pair in the header. You can do this by using any API product, such as [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/), or directly using the command line:

```sh
curl example.com/REGISTERED_ROUTE -H "Authorization: Basic CLIENT_ID:CLIENT_SECRET"
```

Where `example.com` is the address of the runtime instance you are running.

## Using Auth0 actions

[Auth0 actions](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions) can be used to customize the application in Auth0. Using Auth0 actions, you can configure the application name in Auth0 to be something custom, instead of the default name set by the developer in the Dev Portal. Here's an example that sets the application name to be `konnect_portal_id+konnect_developer_id+konnect_application_id`. For some other actions it is possible to make changes directly via the api object passed to the `onExecuteCredentialsExchange`.

1. Follow the [Auth0 documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/customize/actions/write-your-first-action#create-an-action) to create a custom action on the "Machine to Machine" flow.

2. Use the following code as an example for what your action could look like. Update the initial `const` variables with the values from the when you configured DCR.

   ```js

   const axios = require("axios");

   const INITIAL_CLIENT_AUDIENCE = 
   const INITIAL_CLIENT_ISSUER = 
   const INITIAL_CLIENT_ID = 
   const INITIAL_CLIENT_SECRET = 

   exports.onExecuteCredentialsExchange = async (event, api) => {
      const metadata = event.client.metadata
      if (!metadata.konnect_portal_id) {
         return
      }
      const newClientName = `${metadata.konnect_portal_id}+${metadata.konnect_developer_id}+${metadata.konnect_application_id}`
      await updateApplication(event.client.client_id, {
         name: newClientName
      })
   };

   async function getShortLivedToken() {
      const tokenEndpoint = new URL('/oauth/token', INITIAL_CLIENT_ISSUER).href
      const headers = {
         'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      }

      const payload = {
         client_id: INITIAL_CLIENT_ID,
         client_secret: INITIAL_CLIENT_SECRET,
         audience: INITIAL_CLIENT_AUDIENCE,
         grant_type: 'client_credentials'
      }

      const result = await
      axios.post(`${tokenEndpoint}`, payload, {
         headers
      })
      .then(x => x.data)
      .catch(e => {
         const msg = 'Unable to create one time access token'
         throw new Error(msg)
      })

      if (!result.access_token) {
         const msg = 'Unable to find one time access token from result'
         throw new Error(msg)
      }

      return result.access_token
   }

   async function updateApplication(clientId, update) {
      const shortLivedToken = await getShortLivedToken()
      const getApplicationEndpoint = new URL(`/api/v2/clients/${clientId}`, INITIAL_CLIENT_ISSUER).href
      const headers = makeHeaders(shortLivedToken)


      return await axios.patch(getApplicationEndpoint,
         update,
         { headers })
         .catch(e => {
            const msg = `Unable to update Application from auth0 ${e}`
            throw new Error(msg)
         })
   }

   function makeHeaders(token) {
      return {
         Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
         accept: 'application/json',
         'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
   }
   ```

3. Be sure to apply this action on "Machine to Machine" flow, it will then run each time a `client_credentials` request is made. After a request with is made you can see the updated application name in the Auth0 dashboard.
