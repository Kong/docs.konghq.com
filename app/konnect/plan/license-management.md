title: License Management in Konnect Cloud
no_version: true
---

When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, a license is
automatically provisioned to the organization. You do not need to manage this
license manually.

Any runtimes configured through the [Runtime Manager](/konnect/configure/runtime-manager)
also implicitly receive the same license from {{site.konnect_saas}}
control plane. You should never have to deal with a license
directly.

For any license questions, contact your sales representative.
