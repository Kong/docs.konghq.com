title: Manage Konnect Services
---

Through the [Service Hub](https://cloud.konghq.com/servicehub/), you can
create and manage all {{site.konnect_short_name}} services, service versions, and service
implementations in one place.

Access all {{site.konnect_short_name}} service configuration through the {% konnect_icon servicehub %}
**Service Hub**.

## Add a service to the catalog

1. In the {% konnect_icon servicehub %} [**Service Hub**](https://cloud.konghq.com/servicehub), click the **New service** button.

1. Enter a display name.

    A display name can be any string containing letters, numbers, spaces, or the following
    characters: `.`, `-`, `_`, `~`, `:`. Spaces are equal to the `-` character.

    For example, you can use `example_service`, `ExampleService`, `Example-Service`, or `Example Service`.
    `Example-Service` and `Example Service` would be considered the same name.

    The display name you create generates a service name. {{site.konnect_short_name}}
    uses the service name for internal metadata.

1. Optional: Enter a description.

1. Click **Create**.

## Add labels to a service

1. Click **Add label** and add any labels in `key:value` pair format.

    For example, you might set `location:us-west`, where `location` is the key
    and the `us-west` is the value.

    These labels are customizable, you can set them to any value.

1. Click **Save**.
