Through the [Service Hub](https://cloud.konghq.com/servicehub/), you can
create and manage all {{site.konnect_short_name}} Services, Service versions, and Service
implementations in one place.

Access all {{site.konnect_short_name}} Service configuration through the {% konnect_icon servicehub %}
**Service Hub**.

## Add a Service to the catalog

1. In the {% konnect_icon servicehub %} Service Hub, click **+ New service**.

1. Enter a **Display name**.

    A display name can be any string containing letters, numbers, or the following
    characters: `.`, `-`, `_`, `~`, or `:`. Do not use spaces in display names.

    For example, you can use `service_name`, `ServiceName`, or `Service-name`.
    However, `Service Name` is invalid.

    A new Service is created and {{site.konnect_short_name}} automatically
    redirects to the Service's overview page.

element to reveal a text box, enter the new text, then click outside of the text
box to save.

Service that you have access to.
