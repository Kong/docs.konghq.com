title: Konnect Service Dashboard
---

The Konnect Service Package Dashboard is the place to manage services, versions, and documentation. The dashboard is available by clicking any Service Package in the Service Hub. 

Here are some of the things you can do from the Service package Dashboard: 

* Configure a service
* Publish a service to the Dev Portal
* Manage versions and labels. 
* View traffic, error, and latency data.

Number | Item | Description
-------|------|------------
1 | **Service Versions** | This section displays the status of a service version. From the context menu you can **Delete** a service, or use the **View Details** button to navigate to that versions dashboard. 
2 | **Analytics** | Analytics data for the service. You can configure the analytics options using the [**Analytics tool**](/konnect/analytics/)
3 | **Documentation** | You can add markdown documentation for your service. The documentation will render in the dashboard. If the service is published, the documentation will be available to developers in the Dev Portal. 



### Service versions

A {{site.konnect_short_name}} service version is associated with a [runtime group](/konnect/runtime-manager/runtime-groups/). As such, the configurations, plugins, specific implementations that are associated with the runtime group are also associated with the service version. 

Services can have multiple service versions, and each version can be associated with a different runtime group. Services can be made available in multiple environments by creating service versions in different runtime groups.

A common use case is environment specialization.
For example, if you have three runtime groups for `development`, `staging`, and
`production`, you can manage which environment the service is available in by
assigning a version to that group at creation time. You might have v1 running
in `production`, and be actively working on v2 in `development`. Once it's
ready to test, you'd create v2 in `staging` before finally creating v2 in
`production` alongside v1.

    These labels are customizable. 
    See the [Labels](/konnect/reference/labels/) reference for more information on label formatting.

### Analytics

The analytics dashboard shown in the **Service Dashboard** is a high level overview of **traffic**, **error**, and **latency** for the service. These reports are generated automatically based on the traffic to the service. For more information about analytics read the [analytics documentation](/konnect/analytics/)

### Documentation

The **Service Dashboard** can be used to manage documentation for your service. Documentation can be either an API spec, or Markdown documentation for the service. Once the documentation is uploaded it can be edited from the dashboard. The documentation can be consumed accessed once the service is published.

### {{site.base_gateway}} implementations

When configuring a {{site.base_gateway}} implementation of a service, you'll
need to specify a route. Routes determine how successful requests are sent to
their services after they reach the API gateway. A single service version
can have only one implementation, but potentially many routes.

{:.important}
> **Important**: Starting with {{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.0.0, the router supports logical expressions.
Regex routes must begin with a `~` character. For example: `~/foo/bar/(?baz\w+)`.
Learn more in the [route configuration guide](/gateway/latest/key-concepts/routes/expressions/).

After configuring the service, version, implementation, and at least one route,
youâ€™ll be able to start making requests through {{site.konnect_saas}}.
