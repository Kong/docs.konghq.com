title: License Management in Konnect Cloud
no_version: true
---

When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, a license is
automatically provisioned to the Cloud service. You do not need to manage this
license manually.

Any runtimes configured through the [Runtime Manager](/konnect/runtime-manager)
also implicitly receive the same license from {{site.konnect_saas}}
control plane.

For any license questions, contact your sales representative.
