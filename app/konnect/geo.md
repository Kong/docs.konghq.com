## Geo management

When you create a {{site.konnect_saas}} account, you select a geographic region for your instance. Geos are distinct deployments of {{site.konnect_short_name}} with objects, such as services and consumers, that are geo-specific. Only authentication, billing, and usage is shared between {{site.konnect_short_name}} geos.

The following objects are geo-specific and are not shared between geos:

* [Services](/konnect/service-catalog/)
* [API products](/konnect/api-products/)
* [Service meshes and mesh zones](/konnect/mesh-manager/)
* [Routes](/konnect/getting-started/implement-service/)
* [Consumers](/konnect/gateway-manager/configuration/)
* [Application registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/)
* [Custom teams and roles](/konnect/org-management/teams-and-roles/)
* [Dev portals](/konnect/dev-portal/)
