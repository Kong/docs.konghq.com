Anyone accessing a {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal needs to register as a Developer for that specific Dev Portal, including {{site.konnect_short_name}} admins. This means that admins will have separate credentials for [Konnect](https://konnect.konghq.com/) and the Dev Portal.

All Developer registrations are either automatically or manually approved by {{site.konnect_short_name}} service admins and organization admins. For instructions on registering as a Developer, see [Register as a Developer](#register-as-a-developer).

## Locate Dev Portal URL

Admins can find the Dev Portal URL in [konnect.konghq.com](https://konnect.konghq.com/). If you don't have admin access and want to register as a Developer, ask your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin for the Dev Portal URL.

{:.note}
> **Note**: If you are an admin planning to create Applications and register Services, you must also [Register as a Developer](#register-as-a-developer).

1. As an admin, log in to [konnect.konghq.com](https://konnect.konghq.com/).

2. Use the left-side menu to navigate to **Dev Portal**, then **Published Services**.

3. Under the title heading **Published Services**, see the **Portal URL** link.

## Register as a Developer

All Developers must register through the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal. As each Dev Portal has a unique URL, reach out to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin for the URL you should access.

1. Navigate to the {{site.konnect_short_name}} Dev Portal URL provided by your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin.

2. At the bottom of the login form, click **Sign Up**.

3. Fill out the registration form and click **Create Account**.

4. Check your email for registration confirmation.

5. After you have confirmed your email and received approval from your admin, log
into the Dev Portal.

    If your admin has auto-approve enabled, you can log in right after confirming
    your email. Otherwise, you _will not be able_ to log in until your admin approves
    the request. If you try to log in right after creating the account and receive an
    error message, it's likely that the admin hasn't approved your account yet.

Contact your {{site.konnect_short_name}} admin if you have login issues.
