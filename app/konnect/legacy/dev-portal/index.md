The Dev Portal is an API Catalog that allows Admin roles to
document and manage Application registration for your Services. Admin roles publish Services through Konnect, and Developers use those Services.

The Dev Portal lives at a separate URL from Konnect and requires that all users, including Admin roles, [register as a Developer](/konnect/legacy/dev-portal/access-and-approval/dev-reg/).
