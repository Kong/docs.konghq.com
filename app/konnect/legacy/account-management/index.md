{{site.konnect_product_name}} has [three plans](/konnect-platform/plans) to
choose from: Free, Plus, and Enterprise. When you first sign up, you get
automatically enrolled into a 30-day free trial for Konnect Plus. At the end of
this trial, you can choose to continue with Plus, or downgrade to Free.

You can view service, Dev Portal, and API call usage from the **Billing and Usage**
settings page, and manage your Konnect Free or Plus plan from this page.
