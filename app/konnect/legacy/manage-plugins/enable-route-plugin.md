Enable, update, disable, or delete a plugin for a Route.

## Enable a Plugin

1. From the left navigation menu, open the **Services** page.

2. Select a Service version.

3. Scroll down to the **Routes** section and select a Route.

4. From the **Plugins** section, select **Add Plugin**.

5. Find and select a plugin.

6. Enter the plugin configuration details. These will differ for every plugin.

    See the [Plugin Hub](/hub) for parameter descriptions.

7. Click **Create** to save.

## Update, Disable, or Delete a Plugin

Disabling a plugin leaves its configuration intact, and you can re-enable the
plugin at any time.

Deleting a plugin completely removes it and its configuration from
{{site.konnect_short_name}}.

1. Return to the overview page for your Route by going to **Services** >
**Service-name** > **Version-name** > **Route-name**.

2. Scroll down to the **Plugins** section and select a plugin.

4. Click **Edit Plugin** in the top right. On the configuration page:

    * To update, adjust any values, then click **Update** to save changes.

    * To disable the plugin, switch the toggle at the top of the page. The
    toggle should now display:

        ```
        This plugin is Disabled.
        ```

        Click **Update** to save changes.

    * To delete, scroll to the bottom and click **Delete**.
