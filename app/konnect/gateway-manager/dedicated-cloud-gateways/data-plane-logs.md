Data plane logs provide users with the ability to view, filter, search, and download logs for the data plane nodes associated with a Dedicated Cloud Gateway. This feature is essential for debugging, monitoring, and understanding the behavior of data plane nodes.


## Log Management Features

You can access data plane logs from the Data Plane Dashboard in [Gateway Manager](https://cloud.konghq.com/us/gateway-manager/): Choose a Dedicated Cloud Gateway control plane > **Data Plane Nodes** in side menu > **Logs** tab. 

From here, you can perform the following actions:

| **Feature**                   | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **View Logs**                 | Access detailed logs for all data plane nodes in your gateway.                 |

| **Download Logs**             | Click the **Download Icon** near the log table to save logs locally.|
