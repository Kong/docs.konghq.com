Dedicated cloud gateways are a type of API gateway in {{site.konnect_short_name}} that are completely managed in the cloud provider of your choice. With a dedicated cloud infrastructure, you control the sizing and deployment locations of the gateway infrastructure and Kong manages the operations of individual instances and the cluster for you.

In just a few steps, you can configure a dedicated cloud gateway using the UI wizard in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. You can manage your dedicated cloud gateways alongside all your other gateways in Gateway Manager.

Dedicated cloud gateways have the following benefits over a typical hybrid gateway:

* **Pre-warm a cluster:** You can pre-warm your cluster by specifying the number of requests per second so that the first requests donâ€™t have to wait for the infrastructure to scale up.
* **Fast setup:** Configure and start your dedicated cloud gateway in four steps.  
* **SOC1 compliant:** Dedicated cloud gateways are SOC1 compliant out-of-the-box.
* **Kong-managed:** Kong manages the cluster for you, all you need to do is configure a few settings. 
* **One-click upgrades:** {{site.konnect_short_name}} handles upgrades for you. You decide when you want to upgrade and what {{site.base_gateway}} version you want to upgrade to and {{site.konnect_short_name}} does it for you. There's no downtime when upgrading the infrastructure.
* **Multi-region:** Dedicated cloud gateways are supported on the following AWS regions: Sydney, Tokyo, Singapore, Frankfurt, Ireland, London, Ohio, Oregon.
