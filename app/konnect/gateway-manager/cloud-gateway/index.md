Dedicated cloud gateways are a type of API gateway in {{site.konnect_short_name}} that are completely managed in the cloud provider of your choice. With a dedicated cloud infrastructure, you have control over the sizing and deployment locations of the gateway infrastructure, without having to manage the operations of individual instances that we will be deploying for them, nor they directly manage operations of the cluster other than specifying the desidered state.

In just a few clicks, you can configure a dedicated cloud gateway using the UI wizard in {{site.konnect_short_name}}. You can manage your dedicated cloud gateways alongside all your other gateways.
