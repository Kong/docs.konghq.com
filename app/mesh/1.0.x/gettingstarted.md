title: Getting Started with Kong Mesh
---

## Getting Started

{{site.mesh_product_name}} &mdash; built on top of CNCF's Kuma and Envoy &mdash;
 tries to be as close as possible to the usage of Kuma itself, while providing
 drop-in binary replacements for both the control plane and data plane
 executables.

You can download the {{site.mesh_product_name}} binaries from the
[official installation page](/mesh/{{page.kong_version}}/install), then follow
[Kuma's official documentation](https://kuma.io/docs) to start using the product.

For {{site.mesh_product_name}}'s enterprise features, take a look at the
[enterprise documentation](/mesh/{{page.kong_version}}/features).

   Kuma, a donated CNCF project, was originally created by Kong, which is
   currently maintaining both the project and the documentation.
