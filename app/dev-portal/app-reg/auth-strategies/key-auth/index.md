title: Key Auth

Key authentication is Konnect's built-in API Authetication Strategy. When Developers sign up and create an Application, they will be granted credentials. 

Your Dev Portal is automatically created with a "Key Auth" Authentication Strategy. If you selected **Private** when creating your Dev Portal, this will be the Default Authentication Strategy in Security Settings.
