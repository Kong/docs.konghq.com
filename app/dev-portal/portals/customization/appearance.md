# Appearance

Appearance settings are applied globally to all pages in your Dev Portal. Appearance can be found in Portal Editor on the left sidebar.

## Basic Appearance

Basic appearance settings quickly create basic styles for your default portal template.

* Theme: light and dark options are provided. This changes the background and text in your default template. Dark/light is not selectable by Developers.
* Brand color: this color will be used to set the primary color in the default template.
* Portal logo: this will be automatically used in the header, as well as footer menu sections, ensuring consistent branding on every page.
* Favicon: this is an icon that will be displayed in the browser tab for Dev Portal visitors, as well as in Favorites in the web browser.

## Custom CSS

For advanced needs, you can also create Custom CSS that applies custom styles to your Dev Portal. Custom CSS provides global customization to all pages in Dev Portal.
