Customization can be found on the left sidebar when a Dev Portal is selected.

## Menus 

### Visibility

All menu items have visibility controls. Visibility is `Private` by default, and will only be displayed to logged-in Developers. If `Public` is selected, the menu item will be available to all visitors to your Dev Portal.

### Main Menu

Main Menus are a flat list of links that will be added to the header of every page in your Dev Portal. These titles/links will be spaced evenly horizontally.

### Footer Menu Sections

Footer Menus allow you to create a set of columns with links for global navigation. Select **Footer Sections Menu** from the dropdown list to begin creating your menus.

Footer Sections create vertical columns across the bottom of every Page, with the Logo from [Appearance](/dev-portal/portals/appearance) on the left side. It's best to create your desired Footer Sections before creating Footer Menu Items.

Footer Menu Items are links to any URL you prefer, with a title to be displayed. Items must specify a Footer Menu Section.

### Footer Bottom Menu

Footer Bottom Menu is a flat list of links that will be added to the bottom of every page. Footer Bottom Menus are placed below Footer Menu Sections.


## SEO

To optimize how search engines crawl your Dev Portal, you have the ability to specify `/robots.txt` directly.
