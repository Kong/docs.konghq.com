title: Markdown rules and formatting
no_version: true

## Markdown front matter

Every Markdown file on the doc site (excluding `docs.konghq.com/hub/`) starts with
some YAML front matter. This section must have at least one parameter (`title`),
and you can also set additional parameters to change how the doc renders in the
output.

Plugin Hub docs have specialized front matter elements. See the
[plugin contribution docs](/contributing/plugin-docs) for details.

**Required:**

`title: {PAGE_TITLE}`
: The title of the topic you're adding.

**Optional:**

`no_version: true`
: Disables the version selector dropdown. Set this on pages that belong to
unversioned doc sets like `/konnect/`.

`beta: true` or `alpha: true`
: Labels the page as beta or alpha; adds a banner to the top of the page.

`disable_image_expand: true`
: Stops images from expanding in a modal on click. Sets it for the entire page.

`class: no-copy-code`
: Disables the copy code button ( <i class="fa fa-copy"></i> ) for all
codeblocks on the page.

### Examples

A versionless Konnect page for a beta feature:

```yaml
---
title: My Page
no_version: true
beta: true
---
```

A Kong Gateway doc (with versions) that you don't want people to copy code from,
and where you don't want any of the images to be expandable:

```yaml
---
title: My Gateway API Doc
class: no-copy-code
disable_image_expand: true
---
```


## Variables

Use variables for product names and release versions. See
[Variables](/contributing/variables) for syntax and when to use each one.

## Headers

Headers should not contain any code. Use plain text instead. Use title case
for all headers, per [Content best practices](/contributing/style-guide/#content-best-practices).

## Links

### Content in markdown files

* **Use relative links:** In markdown (`.md`) files, use links relative to the root
domain (`docs.konghq.com`).

    For example, if the final link for a page will be `docs.konghq.com/konnect/servicehub`,
    you would write `/konnect/servicehub`.

* **Use version variables when possible:** For versioned doc sets such as Kong
Gateway and Kong Mesh, use the page version variable.

    For example: {% raw %}`/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/file`{% endraw %}

* **Use `latest` in unversioned docs:** If you're linking to a versioned topic
from an unversioned topic, use `/latest/` instead of a version name or variable.

### Add new entries to the ToC

If you're adding a new topic (or editing the name or location of an existing
one), you also need to add it to the `yml` nav file for its version. These are
located under `app/_data`. In these files, the path is relative to the versioned
folder.

For example, if the project path is `app/enterprise/2.1.x/overview`, the path in
the nav file would be `/overview`, and you would add it to the file
`app/_data/docs_nav_ee_2.1.x.yml`.

### Add redirects

If you're making an organization change like updating page nesting or renaming a top-level
menu item, you'll need to set up a redirect. Redirects prevent `404` pages, and
redirect users automatically to the new content location.

1. Navigate to `app` then `_redirects`.
2. Find the section of the documentation for which the redirect applies. For example, Dev Portal.
3. Add a new line with the link you want to redirect **from**.
4. On the same line, add the link you want to redirect **to**.

```bash
\\ Start the link with what appears after https://docs.konghq.com/.

\\ In the following example, we created a new menu section called Applications
in the Dev Portal section of the docs. And we moved the dev-apps page to our
new menu section.

/konnect/dev-portal/developers/dev-apps                    /konnect/dev-portal/applications/dev-apps
```

{:.important}
> **Important:** When making organizational changes, update all internal links
in the documentation to the new links. **Don't** rely on redirects to change
internal links. Redirects are not great for SEO (search engine optimization),
and they create slower page loading times, especially if there's a redirect chain.

## Codeblocks

Codeblocks are containers for your code examples. In Markdown, you can create
them using three backticks, or fenced codeblocks:

````
```bash
some code here
```
````

Include a language whenever possible (in the example above, that language is
`bash`). This will format your codeblocks using language-specific syntax.

You can also create tabbed codeblocks, so that users can easily switch to
their preferred format. See [tabs for codeblocks](#tabs-for-codeblocks).

If you're including placeholders in codeblocks, use HTML tags instead of
backticks. See [editable placeholders](#editable-placeholders-in-codeblocks).

## Placeholders

Use placeholders in both inline text and in codeblocks to
denote a value that the user should edit. Always enclose placeholders in code
formatting.

### Inline placeholders

If you're adding a placeholder inline, such as in a sentence, enclose it in single
backticks: \`{EXAMPLE_TEXT}`

### Editable placeholders in codeblocks

If you have text in your codeblock that you want the user to edit before running
the code, you can use editable placeholders.

Editable placeholders require HTML markup. They are not supported in pure markdown (fenced) codeblocks.

{:.important}
> **Important:** Use plaintext placeholders for sensitive personal
information, and **do not** use editable placeholders for these values. Personal
information includes:
> * Passwords
> * Usernames
> * Emails

#### Create an editable placeholder

* Enclose the entire codeblock in a `<div>` tag with a "copy-code-snippet" class: `<div class="copy-code-snippet"></div>`
* Use the `<pre>` and `<code>` tags to create a codeblock
* Enclose your placeholder in `<div contenteditable="true"></div>` tags
* Do not add any newlines around the `pre` and `code` tags. These tags read
their contents very literally, so all newlines will output as newlines.
* HTML codeblocks can't pick up syntax highlighting. For consistency, if you're
using fenced codeblocks elsewhere on the same page, set the language to
`plaintext`.

**Do:**
{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab Input %}
```
<div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>host: <div contenteditable="true">{EXAMPLE_VALUE}</div>
port: 80 </code></pre></div>
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Output %}
<div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>host: <div contenteditable="true">{EXAMPLE_VALUE}</div>
port: 80 </code></pre></div>
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

**Don't:**
{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab Input %}
```
<div class="copy-code-snippet">
  <pre>
    <code>
    host: <div contenteditable="true">{EXAMPLE_VALUE}</div>
    port: 80
    </code>
  </pre>
</div>
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Output %}
<div class="copy-code-snippet">
  <pre>
      <code>
      host: <div contenteditable="true">{EXAMPLE_VALUE}</div>
      port: 80
      </code>
  </pre>
</div>
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

## Tabs

If your topic provides instructions for two or more methods of completing a
task, you can nest them inside `navtabs`. For example,
[this topic](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/get-started/comprehensive/expose-services/#add-a-service)
tabs between the Admin API and Kong Manager methods for adding a Service.

{:.important}
> **Important:** You can’t use tabs in lists, or nest tabs within tabs.

Here's how you use them:

{% raw %}
```
{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Example title %}

Here's some content.

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Another example title %}

Here's some more content.

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
```
{% endraw %}

And here's the output:

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab Example title %}

Here's some content.

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Another example title %}

Here's some more content.

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

You can automatically select a specific tab (or set of tabs) on a page using the `tab` URL parameter.
For example:
https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/2.7.x/get-started/comprehensive/protect-services/?tab=using-deck-yaml

The value provided to `?tab` is the lowercase title of the navtab, with all non-alphanumeric characters removed and spaces replaced with `-`.

Examples:

* `Using Kong Manager` => `using-kong-manager`
* `Using the Admin API` => `using-the-admin-api`
* `Using decK (YAML)` => `using-deck-yaml`

If you're unsure what value to use, view the page source and search for `data-slug` to see the generated slug.

If there are multiple sets of tabs to enable, you can provide multiple tab names, separated by a comma:

```
?tab=using-the-admin-api,using-deck-yaml
```

This will activate the `Using the Admin API` tab, then the `Using decK (YAML)` tabs. The order may be important if you are reusing tab names across contexts.
See this [sample link to the getting started guide with Admin API and decK tabs selected](/gateway/2.7.x/get-started/comprehensive/protect-services/?tab=using-the-admin-api,using-deck-yaml).

When using `?tab=`, it *must* come before any URL fragments (`#`) in the URL:

* <i class="fa fa-check"></i> Good URL: /gateway/2.7.x/get-started/comprehensive/protect-services/?tab=using-deck-yaml#validate-rate-limiting
* <i class="fa fa-times"></i> Bad URL: /gateway/2.7.x/get-started/comprehensive/protect-services/#validate-rate-limiting/?tab=using-deck-yaml

### Tabs for codeblocks

A specialized use of navtabs is the `codeblock` style. This creates copyable
tabbed codeblocks for easy code comparison and better use of space.

{:.important}
> **Important:** Codeblock tabs must contain codeblocks and **nothing else** --
not even extra blank lines.

To create a tabbed codeblock, set the `codeblock` class in the first element
when creating a `navtabs` group:

{% raw %}
````
{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab cURL %}
```sh
$ curl some request
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab HTTPie %}
```sh
$ httpie some request
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
````
{% endraw %}

And here's what that looks like:

{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab cURL %}
```sh
$ curl some request
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab HTTPie %}
```sh
$ httpie some request
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

### Tabs for OSS/Enterprise

> Important: `navtabs_ee` currently only works for Gateway documentation

When using `navtabs` to render content for both Open Source and Enterprise versions
of a product, you should use the `navtabs_ee` block instead of `navtabs`. This hides
the inline tab selection and adds a "Switch to Enterprise/OSS" option on the right hand
side of the page.

`navtabs_ee` expects the tabs to be called `Kong Gateway` and `Kong Gateway (OSS)`, and
that the enterprise tab will always be shown first.

Here's an example of how to use them:

````
{% raw %}
{% navtabs_ee codeblock %}
{% navtab Kong Gateway %}
```bash
This will be shown when Enterprise is selected
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Kong Gateway (OSS) %}
```bash
This will be shown when OSS is selected
 ```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs_ee %}
{% endraw %}
````

The Enterprise tab is shown by default. Add `?install=oss` to your URL if you'd like
to link to the OSS install instructions for on a page.

### Indenting tabs in an ordered list

Sometimes you are writing an ordered list of steps and may need to include multiple
ways to complete the task, like with the Admin API as well as the Kong Manager UI, and
want to include tabs. Tabs do not indent well though and often reset the numbering of
ordered lists.

To indent your tabs so you can maintain your numbering, including codeblock tabs,
you can use the indent filter on a capture of your tabs.

{% raw %}
```
{% capture the_code %}
{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab cURL %}
<div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>curl -i -X POST http://<div contenteditable="true">{HOSTNAME}</div>:8001/event-hooks \
-d source=crud \
-d event=consumers \
-d handler=webhook \
-d config.url=<div contenteditable="true">{WEBHOOK_URL}</div></code></pre></div>
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab HTTPie %}
<div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>http -f :8001/event-hooks \
source=crud \
event=consumers \
handler=webhook \
config.url=<div contenteditable="true">{WEBHOOK_URL}</div></code></pre></div>
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ the_code | indent }}
```
{% endraw %}

And here's what it looks like:

To make a technical writer smile, **always** do the following:

1. Use the Oxford comma. It matters. (With indent filter)

{% capture the_code %}
{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab cURL %}
<div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>curl -i -X POST http://<div contenteditable="true">{HOSTNAME}</div>:8001/event-hooks \
-d source=crud \
-d event=consumers \
-d handler=webhook \
-d config.url=<div contenteditable="true">{WEBHOOK_URL}</div></code></pre></div>
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab HTTPie %}
<div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>http -f :8001/event-hooks \
source=crud \
event=consumers \
handler=webhook \
config.url=<div contenteditable="true">{WEBHOOK_URL}</div></code></pre></div>
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}
{% endcapture %}
{{ the_code | indent }}

2. Laugh at all of their awesome puns. Using puns used to be considered a sign of great intelligence afterall. (Without the indent filter)

  {% navtabs codeblock %}
  {% navtab cURL %}
  <div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>curl -i -X POST http://<div contenteditable="true">{HOSTNAME}</div>:8001/event-hooks \
  -d source=crud \
  -d event=consumers \
  -d handler=webhook \
  -d config.url=<div contenteditable="true">{WEBHOOK_URL}</div></code></pre></div>
  {% endnavtab %}
  {% navtab HTTPie %}
  <div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>http -f :8001/event-hooks \
  source=crud \
  event=consumers \
  handler=webhook \
  config.url=<div contenteditable="true">{WEBHOOK_URL}</div></code></pre></div>
  {% endnavtab %}
  {% endnavtabs %}

3. Bring chocolate. There's nothing wrong with bribery. (Without the indent filter)

  {% navtabs codeblock %}
  {% navtab cURL %}
  <div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>curl -i -X POST http://<div contenteditable="true">{HOSTNAME}</div>:8001/event-hooks \
  -d source=crud \
  -d event=consumers \
  -d handler=webhook \
  -d config.url=<div contenteditable="true">{WEBHOOK_URL}</div></code></pre></div>
  {% endnavtab %}
  {% navtab HTTPie %}
  <div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>http -f :8001/event-hooks \
  source=crud \
  event=consumers \
  handler=webhook \
  config.url=<div contenteditable="true">{WEBHOOK_URL}</div></code></pre></div>
  {% endnavtab %}
  {% endnavtabs %}

## Admonitions

When you need to highlight important information in some way, you can use an
admonition. In our docs, we do this with Markdown blockquotes (`>`) and a class:

```
{:.note}
> **Note**: Here's a note.
```

When using admonitions, think about whether the thing you're trying to note is
_actually_ a note (or warning, or caution), or simply another piece of
information that fits the flow of the task or content on the page. Avoid
nesting too many elements inside admonitions, and try to keep them short.

You can set the admonition label to anything you want. For example, you might
want an `important` note to start with **Protect your password!**.

Set a class on the admonition to display a specific style:

* **Note:** {% raw %}`{:.note}`{% endraw %}

    This is a generic note callout that points out useful information that the
    reader should pay attention to, but won't break anything if it's not followed.
    If you don't use any class at all, the blockquote element defaults to this style.

    {:.note}
    > **Note:** Here's some info.

* **Important:** {% raw %}`{:.important}`{% endraw %}

    Use the `important` callout for something that the reader really
    needs to pay attention to, otherwise the thing they're trying to do won't work.

    {:.important}
    > **Important:** Be cautious about this thing.

* **Warning:** {% raw %}`{:.warning}`{% endraw %}

    Use the `warning` callout for any big breaking changes, or for anything
    irreversible.

    {:.warning}
    > **Warning:** Everything will break forever if you do this.

* **No icon:** {% raw %}`{:.no-icon}`{% endraw %}

    If you have a situation where you need to use a specific admonition type but
    the icon doesn't belong, you can hide the icon by setting `no-icon` along
    with any other admonition class. For example, here's the result of using `{:.warning .no-icon}`:

    {:.warning .no-icon}
    > This is something that's vital in a special way and the icon doesn't apply.

## Page-level navigation

Almost all pages have an automatic table of contents (ToC) added to the right of
the page.

To disable it for pages that don't have any headers, add `toc: false` to the
page front matter.

The ToC generator depends on headings being correctly nested in Markdown,
and will only pick up H2 and H3 level headings.

**Do:**
```markdown
## Sub-heading Level 2
### Sub-sub-heading Level 3
## Sub-heading Level 2
```
Here, the headings are nested correctly, with the smaller heading H3 contained
within H2.

**Don't:**
```markdown
### Sub-sub-heading Level 3
## Sub-heading Level 2
### Sub-sub-heading Level 3
```
With this order, the first H3 gets skipped.

## Badges

Use badges when you need to label a heading, a page, or some other element as
a specific Konnect tier or DB-less compatible.

Badge | HTML tag | Markdown tag
------|----------|-------------
<span class="badge free"></span> | `<span class="badge free"></span>` | `{:.badge .free}`
<span class="badge plus"></span> | `<span class="badge plus"></span>` | `{:.badge .plus}`
<span class="badge enterprise"></span> | `<span class="badge enterprise"></span>` | `{:.badge .enterprise}`
<span class="badge dbless"></span> | `<span class="badge dbless"></span>` | `{:.badge .dbless}`
<span class="badge beta"></span> | `<span class="badge beta"></span>` | `{:.badge .beta}`
<span class="badge alpha"></span> | `<span class="badge alpha"></span>` | `{:.badge .alpha}`
<span class="badge oss"></span> | `<span class="badge oss"></span>` | `{:.badge .oss}`

For example, you can use the Markdown tag on headers:

```markdown
### Set up the Dev Portal
{:.badge .enterprise}
```

The HTML span tag is useful for including a badge inline:

```html
The Dev Portal <span class="badge plus"></span> is a thing.
```

## Escape Liquid syntax

Jekyll processes all Liquid filters in code blocks. This means that if you are
using a language that contains double curly braces
(`{% raw %}{{ }}{% endraw %}`), you need to place <code>&#123;% raw %}</code>
and <code>&#123;% endraw %}</code> tags around your code.

For example:

{% navtabs codeblock %}
{% navtab Input %}
<div class="copy-code-snippet"><pre><code>&#123;% raw %}'{% raw %}{{ tag "kuma.io/service" }}{% endraw %}.mesh'&#123;% endraw %}</code></pre></div>
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Output %}
```
{% raw %}'{{ tag "kuma.io/service" }}.mesh'{% endraw %}
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

## Icons

You can add the following classes to any Font Awesome or custom icon:

* `inline`: The icon appears inline with text.
* `no-image-expand`: The icon won't open in a modal on click.

If you're using the [`konnect_icon`](#konnect-icon) shortcut, both classes are
already applied to the icons and you don't need to add them manually.

### Unicode icons

We use unicode icons for common icons such as ✅ &nbsp; and ❌ &nbsp;. To make sure the
spacing is correct, insert `&nbsp;` after the icon:

```md
✅ &nbsp; and ❌ &nbsp;
```

If you don't add it, the icon will look like ❌ this.

### Font Awesome

To use a Font Awesome icon, use an `<i>` HTML tag with the name of the icon
set as its class.

For example, the following code snippet:

```
<i class="fas fa-anchor"></i>
```

Resolves to <i class="fas fa-anchor"></i>.


### Custom icons

Custom icons for the Kong docs site are located in the
[`/_assets/images/icons/`](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/tree/main/app/_assets/images/icons)
directory. To add an icon, ensure it meets the following criteria:
* SVG format
* The same icon doesn't already exist in the folder, in unicode, or in the
Font Awesome library.

For most custom icons ([except Konnect](#konnect-icons)), access them like
you would any image in markdown. For example:

```
![document icon](/assets/images/icons/icn-doc.svg){:.inline .no-image-expand}
```

This resolves to ![document icon](/assets/images/icons/icn-doc.svg){:.inline .no-image-expand}.

### Konnect icons

Konnect icons can be found in `app/_assets/images/icons/konnect`.
When adding an icon to this folder, use the naming convention `icn-<name>`.

You can then access a Konnect icon with a shortcut for easy use in text:

```
{% raw %}{% konnect_icon runtimes %}{% endraw %}
# Uses the icon located at /app/_assets/images/icons/konnect/icn-runtimes.svg

{% raw %}{% konnect_icon dev-portal %}{% endraw %}
# Uses the icon located at /app/_assets/images/icons/konnect/icn-dev-portal.svg
```
