title: Word choice and naming
---

Generally:
* Use contractions
* Use simple words and short, concise sentences
* Avoid non-English words. Most commonly, this means avoiding Latin words and abbreviations.
* Use [bias-free, inclusive language](#bias-free-language).
* Capitalize most of Kong's product and component names as proper names, with some notable exceptions. See the [naming table](#product-application-component-names) for details.

## Product and component names

* Product: Either an application that can be used on its own, or a group of modules packaged together (for example, {{site.konnect_short_name}}).
* Component: A module that's packaged with a product, for example, Dev Portal. Can't be used or sold on its own.

Capitalize the following Kong-specific terms and component names:
