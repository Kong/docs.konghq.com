Here, you'll find all the information you need to contribute effectively to our Hackathons. 

## Prep

* Make sure you have a GitHub account set up! That's where you'll find all [our code](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com). 
* Head over to [Community](/contributing/community) to learn docs-as-code if you don't already know the process. 
* Be aware of resources available to you throughout the Hackathon. Is there a Slack channel or other outlet that'll keep you connected? We'll keep you posted about specific Hackathon details. 

## Participation expectations

We're so thankful for contributions, and we also have some participation expectations! These help us to manage incoming PRs and encourage strong community. 

Here are some of our expectations:

* **Your contribution is meaningful**. We put effort into planning and prepping for our Hackathons, and we really appreciate contributions that align with meaningfully improving our Docs and clearly addressing pain points. 
    
    It's helpful to think about your personal motivations for involvement in Hackathons - are you here to learn? Gain confidence in docs-as-code? Get green boxes on your GitHub profile? Have something to show potential employers? All of these motivations can help you remain intentional about your contributions. 

* **You take pride in your contribution**. Is this something you're proud of contributing? Each contribution you make has ripple effect on our community, and we love to see thoughtful PRs. Before submitting a PR, read it through and ask yourself if it's clear, concise, and represents your intentions of being a mindful contributor. 

* **Follow our Community Expectations**. See [Community Expectations](/contributing/community-expectations) for more information.
