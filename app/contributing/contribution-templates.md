At Kong, we use the following four standard content types when we write our documentation:

* Explanation: Documentation that is understanding-oriented because it clarifies and discusses a particular topic.
* How-to: Documentation that is goal-oriented and prescriptive and that takes readers through the steps to complete a real-world problem.
* Reference: Documentation that explains the technology, like API or command line documentation.
* Tutorial: Documentation that helps users learn about a topic by going step-by-step through a series of tasks.

To help anyone interested in writing documentation, we have created templates for the individual content types:

- [Explanation](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/explanation-template.md)
- [How-to](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/how-to-template.md)
- [Reference](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/reference-template.md)
- [Tutorial](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/main/docs/templates/tutorial-template.md)

If you are interested in contributing a new plugin, there is also a [plugin template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/main/app/_hub/_init/my-extension/_index.md) you can follow to help you focus on writing the content not the format.
