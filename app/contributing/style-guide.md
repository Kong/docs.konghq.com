## Formatting standards

### Admonitions

- Do not stack admonitions, in other words, list several admonitions one after the other.<br/>
  Admonitions should be carefully selected, called-out text.
- Admonition types:
  - **Note:** Information concerning behavior that would not be expected, but won't break anything if it's not followed.
  - **Warning:** Information necessary to avoid breaking something or losing data.
  - **Important:** Information that the reader really needs to pay attention to, otherwise things won't work.
For more information about formatting admonitions see [markdown-rules](/contributing/markdown-rules/#admonitions).

## Punctuation rules

- Commas and periods always go inside quotation marks, and colons and semicolons (dashes as well) go outside.
  - For example: “There was a storm last night,” Paul said.

### Placeholder values

- Use single curly braces, all caps text, and underscores between words.

    For example: `{EXAMPLE_VALUE}`

    In codeblocks, use [editable placeholders](/contributing/markdown-rules/#placeholders)
    where you want a user to enter their own value.

## Capitalization guidelines

Follow the user interface (UI). If a term is capitalized in the UI, it should be
capitalized in the documentation.

### Kong-specific terms

See [Word Choice](/contributing/word-choice).

## Code formatting

- Separate commands from output.
- Include properly formatted code comments.
- For long commands, split the code block into separate lines with `\`
to avoid horizontal scrolling.
- Never have more than one command in a block/example.
- Set a language for codeblocks, for example, bash, to enable syntax highlighting.
    - [List of supported languages](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers)
    - If using HTML tags to create a codeblock for editable placeholders,
    see [guidelines for editable placeholders](/contributing/markdown-rules/#editable-placeholders-in-codeblocks)
- Do **NOT** use the command prompt marker ($) in code snippets.

### Inline code formatting

- Enclose sample code with single backticks.<br/>
  For example: \`sudo yum install /path/to/package.rpm`

## Images

- Add files to the corresponding product folder by navigating in the repo from **app > assets > images > docs**.
- When naming/titling image files, use lowercase letters and dashes only.
- Use SVGs whenever possible, otherwise use PNGs.
- Limit image file size to ~2MB.
- Compress and resize images before adding them to the site.
- Do not use shadows.
- Borders can be added to screenshots only `-1px` black.
- Add an `alt` attribute and detailed description of the image.
- **Do not** use GIFs, as they are not accessible and reduce page performance.

## Links

- Don't use link titles like "Read more" and "Click here". Instead, write descriptive titles that properly detail what content is accessible by clicking the link.
- If the linked content is a larger area like a panel, add a `title` attribute that describes the linked content to the `a` tag.
