## Documenting interactions with UI elements

As a general rule, we do not directly document CRUD (create, read, update, delete) tasks in the Kong documentation without any context.

When documenting UI instructions, make sure to write them as part of workflows. 
For example, you might have a multi-section task where you [set up a vault object and use it](/konnect/runtime-manager/configuration/vaults/how-to/), part of which walks you through creating the object in the {{site.konnect_short_name}} UI.

{:.note}
> In cases of escalation around a specific task (for example, users keep struggling to delete a route in Kong Manager), create a troubleshooting doc for that content.
See the [Dev Portal troubleshooting doc](/konnect/dev-portal/troubleshoot/) for an example.

## Best practices for referring to UI elements 

* If the area of a screen only has an icon, refer to it by the title of the element and its icon. For example:  
    
    ✅  **Do:** Click the {% konnect_icon cogwheel %} settings icon.

* Use carets to only describe context menus. For example:
    
    ✅  **Do:** Click **Service actions** > **Add new version**.
    
    ✅  **Do:** Click All > **Services**.
    
    ❌  **Don't:** Click the **Reports** button > **Latency** tab > **Service** tab.

* Say **Click**; do not say **Click on**. For example:
    
    ✅  **Do:** Click the **Reports** button.
    
    ❌  **Don't:** Click on the **Reports** button.

* When referring to buttons or other interactive elements that have plus signs, don't use the plus sign in the documentation.
    
    ✅  **Do:** New Plugin
    
    ❌  **Don't:** + New Plugin

## Screenshots

You can use screenshots to express the capabilities, look and feel, and experience of a feature in situations where exclusively using text would make the documentation harder to understand. We recommend writing the documentation first, **without** using screenshots, and then assessing if a screenshot would enhance the documentation.

Screenshots are used to support documentation and do not _replace_ documentation. In some cases, using wireframes in place of screenshots is easier to maintain. Otherwise, all screenshots must follow these guidelines.

- Screenshots must be taken with browser developer tools.
- Resolution should be set to **1500x845**.
- Screenshots of UI elements should include only the relevant **panel**. Panels are a container within a UI window which contain multiple related elements.
- Mouse should not be visible.
- **Emphasis on elements in the screenshot:** Create a **rectangular** border around the point of interest. 
The border must use the color <span style="color:#0788ad">`#0788ad`</span> from the [colors style guide](https://kongponents.netlify.app/guide/styles/colors.html).
- **Screenshot border:** Set the `image-border` class if your screenshot requires a border. You might need to set a border when:
    * Panels have a white background and will therefore blend into the surrounding area
    * You want to separate the screenshot clearly from another image
    * It's hard to tell which text belongs to the screenshot and which to the page content
- **Do not** use GIFs.
- Limit image file size to ~2MB.
- Add files to the corresponding product folder by navigating in the repo from `app > _assets > images > docs`.
- Use lowercase letters and dashes when naming an image file.
