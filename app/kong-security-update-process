## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

Version date: March 11, 2020

If you have found a vulnerability or a potential vulnerability in the Kong gateway please let us know by emailing [security@konghq.com](mailto:security@konghq.com). We'll send a confirmation email to acknowledge your report, and we'll send an additional email when we've identified the issue positively or negatively.

Once a report is received, we will identify the relevant maintainers to investigate the vulnerability. The maintainers will assign it a [CVSS](https://www.first.org/cvss/) score which will determine the timeline for the development of an appropriate fix.

While the fix development is underway, we ask that you do not share or publicize an unresolved vulnerability with third parties. If you responsibly submitted a vulnerability report, the Kong maintainers will do their best to acknowledge your report in a timely manner and notify you of the estimated timeline for a fix.


## Public Disclosure Process

If you know of a publicly disclosed security vulnerability please IMMEDIATELY email [security@konghq.com](mailto:security@konghq.com) to inform us of the vulnerability.


## Fix Development Process

If a discovered vulnerability with a CVSS score above 4.0 (medium severity or higher) affects the latest major release of the Kong gateway, then the Kong maintainers will work to develop a fix in the most timely manner. The work and communication around the fix will happen in private channels, and a delivery estimate will be given to the vulnerability reporter. Once the fix is developed and verified, a new patch version of the Kong gateway will be released for the current release of the open-source gateway and by Kong for each supported Kong Enterprise release, and the vulnerability will be disclosed as appropriate.

Discovered vulnerabilities with a CVSS score below 4.0 (low severity) will follow the same fix development process, but a less urgent timeline.

Vulnerabilities affecting upstream projects (e.g. NGINX, OpenResty, OpenSSL...) will receive fixes as per the upstream project's disclosure timeline.


## Retrospective

Within a few days of the new release addressing the vulnerability, the Kong maintainers will publish a retrospective with details of the issue, including a description, links to relevant PRs, timeline of the vulnerability report and development of the fix. This retrospective will be published in the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/Kong/kong/security/advisories) section of this repository.
