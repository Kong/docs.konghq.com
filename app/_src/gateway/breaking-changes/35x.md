Before upgrading, review any configuration or breaking changes in this version and prior versions that
affect your current installation.

You may need to adopt different upgrade paths depending on your deployment methods, set of features in use,
custom plugins, for example.


## Plugin Changes

#### Session Plugin 
Introduced a new configuration field read_body_for_logout with a default value of false. This change alters the behavior of logout_post_arg in such a way that it is no longer considered unless read_body_for_logout is explicitly set to true. This adjustment prevents the session plugin from automatically reading request bodies for logout detection, particularly on POST requests.
### Enterprise
#### Rate Limiting Advanced
Resolved a bug in the GraphQL rate limiting advanced plugin for Kong 3.4, where configuring the plugin with a cluster address and the redis strategy resulted in schema violations. Now, users can specify a cluster address without encountering these errors.
