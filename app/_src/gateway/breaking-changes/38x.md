Before upgrading, review any configuration or breaking changes in this version and prior versions that
affect your current installation.

You may need to adopt different [upgrade paths](/gateway/{{page.release}}/upgrade/#guaranteed-upgrade-paths) depending on your 
deployment methods, set of features in use, or custom plugins, for example.

Review the [changelog](/gateway/changelog/#3800) for all the changes in this release.

## Breaking changes and deprecations

### New DNS client
Starting 3.8.x, a new DNS client library was implemented and added to {{site.base_gateway}}. The new DNS client introduces and new standardized way to configure a service, and helps improve performance. It is disabled by default, but will be enabled by default in a future release. For more information, see [Migrate to the new DNS client](/gateway/migrate-to-new-dns-client/).

### `kong.logrotate` configuration file no longer overwritten during upgrade
The `kong.logrotate` configuration file will no longer be overwritten during upgrade.
When upgrading, set the environment variable `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive` on Debian/Ubuntu to avoid any interactive prompts and enable fully automatic upgrades.

### `log_statistics` defaults to `false` for AI Proxy
A configuration validation was added to the [AI Proxy plugin](/hub/kong-inc/ai-proxy/) to prevent users from enabling `log_statistics` for
providers that don't support statistics. In addition, the default of `log_statistics` was changed from
`true` to `false`, and a database migration is added as well for disabling `log_statistics` if it
has already been enabled upon unsupported providers.


### Deprecations

#### `sentinel_addresses` and `cluster_addresses` for Redis

The following plugins switched `cluster_addresses` to `cluster_nodes` and `sentinel_addresses` to `sentinel_nodes` for Redis configuration:
