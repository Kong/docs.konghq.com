images or packages, and Kong will not test package installation on Ubuntu 18.04.

You can migrate from Cassandra DB to PostgreSQL by following the [migration guide](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/migrate-cassandra-to-postgres/), 
or reach out to your support representative for help.

## Configuration changes

The following is a list of changes in `kong.conf`.

LMDB encryption has been disabled. <br><br> The parameter `declarative_config_encryption_mode` has been removed from `kong.conf`. | No action needed.
* The `/consumer_groups/:id/overrides` endpoint is deprecated in favor of a more generic plugin scoping mechanism. 
See the new [consumer groups](https://developer.konghq.com/spec/937dcdd7-4485-47dc-af5f-b805d562552f/25d728a0-cfe3-4cf4-8e90-93a5bb15cfd9#/consumer_groups/get-consumer_groups) entity.
