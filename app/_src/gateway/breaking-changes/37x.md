Before upgrading, review any configuration or breaking changes in this version and prior versions that
affect your current installation.

You may need to adopt different [upgrade paths](/gateway/{{page.release}}/upgrade/#guaranteed-upgrade-paths) depending on your 
deployment methods, set of features in use, or custom plugins, for example.

Review the [changelog](/gateway/changelog/#3700) for all the changes in this release.

## Breaking changes and deprecations

### Configuration

The Granular Tracing feature has been removed from {{site.base_gateway}}.

The following tracing-related `kong.conf` parameters are no longer available. 
Remove them from your configuration when upgrading to 3.7:

* `tracing`
* `tracing_write_strategy`
* `tracing_write_endpoint`
* `tracing_time_threshold`
* `tracing_types`
* `tracing_debug_header`
* `generate_trace_details`

You should now use [OpenTelemetry Instrumentation](/gateway/{{page.release}}/production/tracing/) instead.

### Plugin changes

[**AI Proxy**](/hub/kong-inc/ai-proxy/) (`ai-proxy`): To support the new messages API of `Anthropic`, the upstream 
path of the `anthropic` setting for the `llm/v1/chat` route type has changed from `/v1/complete` to `/v1/messages`.
