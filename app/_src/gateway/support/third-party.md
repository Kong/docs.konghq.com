These are services which are used in day to day operation of {{site.base_gateway}}. Use of these services may be optional, or they may be required by certain plugins.

Kong aims to support the last 2 versions of any third party tool, plus the current managed version if available.

{:.note}
> Some third party tools below do not have a version number. These tools are managed services and Kong provides compatibility with the currently released version
