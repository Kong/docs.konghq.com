title: Enable OpenID Connect in the Dev Portal
badge: enterprise
---

The [OpenID Connect Plugin](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/) (OIDC)
allows the Kong Dev Portal to hook into existing authentication setups using third-party
*Identity Providers* (IdP) such as Google, Okta, Microsoft Azure AD,
[Curity](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-plugins/authentication/oidc/curity/#kong-dev-portal-authentication), etc.

[OIDC](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/) must be used with
the `session` method, utilizing cookies for Dev Portal File API requests.

In addition, a configuration object is required to enable OIDC. Refer to the
[Sample Configuration Object](#/sample-configuration-object) section of this
document for more information.

{:.note}
> **Note**: The Dev Portal does not automatically create developer accounts on login via OIDC.
A developer account matching the `consumer_claim` configuration parameter has to be
created and approved (if auto approve is not enabled) beforehand.
> <br><br>
> During the registration flow, users must enter their login information in their
IDP-redirected login page. The user is then brought to the Dev Portal
registration page and their email is pre-populated in the registration form.
Users cannot change their email in the registration form.
The user may be asked for additional fields, as set by the account admin.

OIDC for the Dev Portal can be enabled in one of the following ways:

- [Portal Session Plugin Config](#portal-session-plugin-config)
- [Sample Configuration Object](#sample-configuration-object)
- [Enable OIDC using Kong Manager](#enable-oidc-using-kong-manager)
- [Enable OIDC using the Command Line](#enable-oidc-using-the-command-line)
- [Enable OIDC using kong.conf](#enable-oidc-using-kongconf)

## Portal Session Plugin Config

Session Plugin Config does not apply when using OpenID Connect.

## Sample Configuration Object

Below is a sample configuration JSON object for using *Google* as the Identity
Provider:

```
{
  "consumer_by": ["username","custom_id","id"],
  "leeway": 1000,
  "scopes": ["openid","profile","email","offline_access"],
  "logout_query_arg": "logout",
  "client_id": ["<CLIENT-ID>"],
  "login_action": "redirect",
  "logout_redirect_uri": ["http://localhost:8003/default"],
  "ssl_verify": false,
  "consumer_claim": ["email"],
  "forbidden_redirect_uri": ["http://localhost:8003/unauthorized"],
  "client_secret": ["<CLIENT_SECRET>"],
  "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com/",
  "logout_methods": ["GET"],
  "login_redirect_uri": ["http://localhost:8003/default"],
  "login_redirect_mode": "query"
}
```

The placeholders above should be replaced with your actual values:

  - `<CLIENT_ID>` - Client ID provided by IdP
  - `<CLIENT_SECRET>` - Client secret provided by IdP
  - `default` - Your workspace name

See the [documentation of the OpenID Connect plugin](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/)
for more information.

**Important:** The `redirect_uri` needs to be configured as an allowed URI in the IdP.
If not set explicitly in the configuration object, the default URI is
`http://localhost:8004/<WORKSPACE_NAME>/auth`.

If `portal_gui_host` and `portal_api_url` are set to share a domain but differ
with regard to subdomain, `redirect_uri` and `session_cookie_domain` need to be
configured to allow OpenID Connect to apply the session correctly.

Example:

```
{
  "consumer_by": ["username","custom_id","id"],
  "leeway": 1000,
  "scopes": ["openid","profile","email","offline_access"],
  "logout_query_arg": "logout",
  "client_id": ["<CLIENT_ID>"],
  "login_redirect_uri": ["https://example.portal.com/default"],
  "login_action": "redirect",
  "logout_redirect_uri": ["https://example.portal.com/default"],
  "ssl_verify": false,
  "consumer_claim": ["email"],
  "redirect_uri": ["https://exampleapi.portal.com/default/auth"],
  "session_cookie_domain": ".portal.com",
  "forbidden_redirect_uri": ["https://example.portal.com/unauthorized"],
  "client_secret": ["<CLIENT_SECRET"],
  "issuer": "https://accounts.google.com/",
  "logout_methods": ["GET"],
  "login_redirect_mode": "query"
}

```

## Enable OIDC using Kong Manager

1. Navigate to the Dev Portal's **Settings** page.
2. Find **Authentication plugin** under the **Authentication** tab.
3. Select **OpenId  Connect** from the drop down.
4. Select **Custom** from the **Auth Config (JSON)** field drop down.
5. Enter your customized [**Configuration JSON Object**](#/sample-configuration-object)
into the provided text area.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

>**Warning** When Dev Portal Authentication is enabled, content files will remain unauthenticated until a role is applied to them. The exception to this is `settings.txt` and `dashboard.txt` which begin with the `*` role. Please visit the <a href="/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/developer-permissions">Developer Roles and Content Permissions</a> section for more info.

## Enable OIDC using the Command Line

You can use the Kong Admin API to set up Dev Portal Authentication.
To patch a Dev Portal's authentication property directly, run:

```
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:8001/workspaces/<WORKSPACE NAME> \
  --data "config.portal_auth=openid-connect"
  "config.portal_auth_conf=<REPLACE WITH JSON CONFIG OBJECT>
```

>**Warning** When Dev Portal Authentication is enabled, content files will remain unauthenticated until a role is applied to them. The exception to this is `settings.txt` and `dashboard.txt` which begin with the `*` role. Please visit the <a href="/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/developer-permissions">Developer Roles and Content Permissions</a> section for more info.

## Enable OIDC using kong.conf

Kong allows for a `default authentication plugin` to be set in the Kong
configuration file with the `portal_auth` property.

In your `kong.conf` file, set the property as follows:

```
portal_auth="openid-connect"
```

Then set the `portal_auth_conf` property to your
customized [**Configuration JSON Object**](#sample-configuration-object).

This will set every Dev Portal to use OIDC by default when initialized, regardless of Workspace.
