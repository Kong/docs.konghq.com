title: Sessions in the Dev Portal
---

{:.important}
> **Important**: Portal Session Configuration does not apply when using [OpenID Connect](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect) for Dev Portal authentication. The following information assumes that the Dev Portal is configured with `portal_auth` other than `openid-connect`; for example, `key-auth` or `basic-auth`.

## How does the Sessions Plugin work in the Dev Portal?

When a user logs in to the Dev Portal with their credentials, the Sessions Plugin will create a session cookie. The cookie is used for all subsequent requests and is valid to authenticate the user. The session has a limited duration and renews at a configurable interval, which helps prevent an attacker from obtaining and using a stale cookie after the session has ended.

The Session configuration is secure by default, which may [require alteration](#session-security) if using HTTP or different domains for [`portal_api_url`](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/reference/configuration/#portal_api_url) and [`portal_gui_host`](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/reference/configuration/#portal_gui_host). Even if an attacker were to obtain a stale cookie, it would not benefit them since the cookie is encrypted. The encrypted session data may be stored either in Kong or the cookie itself.

## Configuration to Use the Sessions Plugin with the Dev Portal

To enable sessions authentication, configure the following:

```
portal_auth = <set to desired auth type>
portal_session_conf = {
    "secret":"<SET_SECRET>",
    "cookie_name":"<SET_COOKIE_NAME>",
    "storage":"kong",
    "cookie_lifetime":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_TO_LIVE>,
    "cookie_renew":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_LEFT_TO_RENEW>,
    "cookie_secure":<SET_DEPENDING_ON_PROTOCOL>,
    "cookie_domain":"<SET_DEPENDING_ON_DOMAIN>",
    "cookie_samesite":"<SET_DEPENDING_ON_DOMAIN>"
}
```

* `"cookie_name":"<SET_COOKIE_NAME>"`: The name of the cookie
  * For example, `"cookie_name":"portal_cookie"`
* `"secret":"<SET_SECRET>"`: The secret used in keyed HMAC generation. Although
  the **Session Plugin's** default is a random string, the `secret` _must_ be
  manually set for use with the Dev Portal since it must be the same across all
  Kong workers/nodes.
* `"storage":"kong"`: Where session data is stored. This value _must_ be set to `kong` for use with the Dev Portal.
* `"cookie_lifetime":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_TO_LIVE>`: The duration (in seconds) that the session will remain open; 3600 by    default.
* `"cookie_renew":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_LEFT_TO_RENEW>`: The duration (in seconds) of a session remaining at which point
   the Plugin renews the session; 600 by default.
* `"cookie_secure":<SET_DEPENDING_ON_PROTOCOL>`: `true` by default. See [Session Security](#session-security) for
    exceptions.
* `"cookie_domain":<SET_DEPENDING_ON_DOMAIN>:` Optional. See [Session Security](#session-security) for exceptions.
* `"cookie_samesite":"<SET_DEPENDING_ON_DOMAIN>"`: `"Strict"` by default. See [Session Security](#session-security) for
    exceptions.

⚠️**Important:**
*The following properties must not be altered from default for use with the Dev Portal:*
* `logout_methods`
* `logout_query_arg`
* `logout_post_arg`

For detailed descriptions of each configuration property, see the [Session Plugin documentation](/hub/kong-inc/session).

## Session Security

The Session configuration is secure by default, so the cookie uses the [Secure, HttpOnly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies), and [SameSite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#SameSite_cookies) directives.

⚠️**Important:** The following properties must be altered depending on the protocol and domains in use:
* If using HTTP instead of HTTPS: `"cookie_secure": false`
* If using different subdomains for the [`portal_api_url`](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/reference/configuration/#portal_api_url) and [`portal_gui_host`](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/reference/configuration/#portal_gui_host), see the example below for [Domains](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/sessions/#domains).

{:.important}
> **Important:** Sessions are not invalidated when a user logs out if `"storage": "cookie"`
(the default) is used. In that case, the cookie is deleted client-side. Only when session data is
stored server-side with `"storage": "kong"` set is the session actively invalidated.

## Example Configurations

### HTTPS with the same domain for API and GUI

If using HTTPS and hosting Dev Portal API and the Dev Portal GUI from the same domain, the following configuration could be used for Basic Auth:

```
portal_auth = basic-auth
portal_session_conf = {
    "cookie_name":"$4m04$"
    "secret":"change-this-secret"
    "storage":"kong"
    "cookie_secure":true
}
```

In testing, if using HTTP, the following configuration could be used instead:

```
portal_auth = basic-auth
portal_session_conf = {
    "cookie_name":"04tm34l"
    "secret":"change-this-secret"
    "storage":"kong"
    "cookie_secure":false
}
```

### Domains

The dev portal `portal_gui_host` and the dev
portal api `portal_api_url` must share a domain or subdomain. The following
example assumes subdomains of `portal.xyz.com` and `portalapi.xyz.com`.
Set a subdomain such as ``"cookie_domain": ".xyz.com"`` and set
`cookie_samesite` to `off`.

```
portal_auth = basic-auth
portal_session_conf = {
    "storage":"kong"
    "cookie_name":"portal_session"
    "cookie_domain": ".xyz.com"
    "secret":"super-secret"
    "cookie_secure":false
    "cookie_lifetime":31557600,
    "cookie_samesite":"off"
}
```
