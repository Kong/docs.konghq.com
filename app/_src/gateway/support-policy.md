## Types of releases
Kong primarily follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (SemVer) with its products. That is, products typically follow a pattern of `{MAJOR_VERSION}.{MINOR_VERSION}.{PATCH_VERSION}`. {{site.ee_product_name}} additionally has one more decimal point on the right which identifies a sub-patch based on the Kong Community Gateway. For the purposes of this support document:

* **Major Version** refers to a version of {{site.ee_product_name}} identified by the number to the left of the leftmost decimal point. For example, 2.1.3.0 has Major Version 2 and 1.3.0.0 has Major Version 1.

* **Minor Version** means a version of the Software identified by a change in the number in between the two leftmost decimal points (x.X.x). For example, 2.1.3.0 has Minor Version 1 and 1.3.0.0 has Minor Version 3.

* The **First Major Version Release** is the first chronologically generally available release of a given Major Version. The First Major Version Release of Major Version 2 of {{site.ee_product_name}} was 2.1.3.0 and the First Major Version Release of Major Version 1 was 1.3.0.0.

* The **Latest Major/Minor Version Release** is the most recent chronologically generally available Minor Version Release of a given Major Version.

For customers with an active enterprise support agreement, beginning with {{site.ee_product_name}} release version 2.1.3.x<sup>*</sup>. Kong provides support for each Major Version Release of {{site.ee_product_name}} for 24 months from the release date of the First Major Version Release.

Support includes:
* Technical support on the use of the software as documented including:
  * Assistance with configuration of the software
  * Guidelines on performance tuning
* Assistance with upgrades to later versions of the Kong software
* Access to bug-fix releases and/or workarounds based on the below Bug Fix Guidelines

**<sup>*</sup>** 24 month support applies starting with {{site.ee_product_name}} 2.1.3.x. For prior releases, support remains at 12 months from the first minor version release. Support for the {{site.kic_product_name}} and {{site.mesh_product_name}} remain at 12 months. The 24 month support applies to {{site.ee_product_name}} standard releases.

## Sunset support
After the product hits the end of the support period, Kong will provide limited support to help the customer upgrade to a fully supported version of {{site.ee_product_name}} for up to an additional 12 month sunset period. Kong will not provide patches for software covered by this sunset period. If there is an issue that requires a patch during this period, the customer will need to upgrade to a newer {{site.ee_product_name}} version covered by 24 month active support.
