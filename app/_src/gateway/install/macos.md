title: Install Kong Gateway on macOS
---

{{site.base_gateway}} is currently not supported through Homebew for MacOS.
We will be adding support for Homebrew installation in an upcoming release.

Check out these other installation options instead:
* For a simple, one-line installation method, try our [Docker quickstart](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/get-started/).
* For a custom solution still running on Docker, check out the [custom Docker installation guide](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/install/docker/).
* See all of our [supported installation options](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/install/).
