Kong Manager is the graphical user interface (GUI) for {{site.base_gateway}}.
It uses the Kong Admin API under the hood to administer and control {{site.base_gateway}}.

Here are some of the things you can do with Kong Manager:

* Manage all workspaces in one place
* Create new routes and services
* Activate or deactivate plugins
* Group your teams, services, plugins, consumer management, and everything else exactly how you want them
* Manage users and roles for both {{site.base_gateway}} and for the Dev Portal
* Configure Dev Portals: customize appearance, manage developers and applications, and edit Dev Portal layouts, specs, and documentation
* Monitor performance: visualize cluster-wide, workspace-level, or even object-level health using intuitive, customizable dashboards

{:.note}
> **Note**: If you are running Kong in [traditional mode](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/production/deployment-topologies/traditional), increased traffic could lead to potential performance issues for the Kong proxy.
> Server-side sorting and filtering large quantities of entities can also cause increased CPU usage in both {{site.base_gateway}} and its database.
