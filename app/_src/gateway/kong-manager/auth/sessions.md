title: Sessions in Kong Manager
badge: enterprise
---

When a user logs in to Kong Manager with their credentials, the Sessions Plugin
will create a session cookie. The cookie is used for all subsequent requests and
is valid to authenticate the user. The session has a limited duration and renews
at a configurable interval, which helps prevent an attacker from obtaining and
 using a stale cookie after the session has ended.

The Session configuration is secure by default, which may
[require alteration](#session-security) if using HTTP or different domains for
the Admin API and Kong Manager. Even if an attacker were to obtain a stale
cookie, it would not benefit them since the cookie is encrypted. The encrypted
session data may be stored either in Kong or the cookie itself.

## Configuration the Sessions plugin for Kong Manager

To enable sessions authentication, configure the following:

{% if_version lte:3.1.x %}
```
enforce_rbac = on
admin_gui_auth = <set to desired auth type>
admin_gui_session_conf = {
    "secret":"<SET_SECRET>",
    "cookie_name":"<SET_COOKIE_NAME>",
    "storage":"<SET_STORAGE>",
    "cookie_lifetime":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_TO_LIVE>,
    "cookie_secure":<SET_DEPENDING_ON_PROTOCOL>
    "cookie_samesite":"<SET_DEPENDING_ON_DOMAIN>"
}
```
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}

```
enforce_rbac = on
admin_gui_auth = <set to desired auth type>
admin_gui_session_conf = {
    "secret":"<SET_SECRET>",
    "cookie_name":"<SET_COOKIE_NAME>",
    "storage":"<SET_STORAGE>",
    "rolling_timeout":<NUMBER_OF_SECONDS_UNTIL_RENEWAL>,
    "cookie_secure":<SET_DEPENDING_ON_PROTOCOL>
    "cookie_same_site":"<SET_DEPENDING_ON_DOMAIN>"
}
```

{% endif_version %}

{% if_version lte:3.1.x %}

Attribute | Description
----------|------------
`cookie_name` | A name for the cookie. <br> For example, `"cookie_name":"kong_cookie"`
`secret` | The secret used in keyed HMAC generation. Although the Session plugin's default is a random string, the `secret` _must_ be manually set for use with Kong Manager since it must be the same across all Kong workers/nodes.
`storage` | The location where session data is stored. <br> The default value is `cookie`. It may be more secure if set to `kong`, since access to the database would be required.
`cookie_lifetime` | The duration (in seconds) that the session will remain open. <br> The default value is `3600`.
`cookie_secure` | Applies the Secure directive so that the cookie may be sent to the server only with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol. See [Session Security](#session-security) for exceptions. <br> The default value is `true`.
`cookie_samesite`| Determines whether and how a cookie may be sent with cross-site requests. See [Session Security](#session-security) for exceptions. <br> The default value is `strict`.

{% endif_version %}

{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}

Attribute | Description
----------|------------
`cookie_name` | A name for the cookie. <br> For example, `"cookie_name":"kong_cookie"`
`secret` | The secret used in keyed HMAC generation. Although the Session plugin's default is a random string, the `secret` _must_ be manually set for use with Kong Manager since it must be the same across all Kong workers/nodes.
`storage` | The location where session data is stored. <br> The default value is `cookie`. It may be more secure if set to `kong`, since access to the database would be required.
`rolling_timeout` | Specifies, in seconds, how long the session can be used until it needs to be renewed. <br> The default value is 3600.
`cookie_secure` | Applies the Secure directive so that the cookie may be sent to the server only with an encrypted request over the HTTPS protocol. See [Session Security](#session-security) for exceptions. <br> The default value is `true`.
`cookie_same_site`| Determines whether and how a cookie may be sent with cross-site requests. See [Session Security](#session-security) for exceptions. <br> The default value is `strict`.

{% endif_version %}

{:.important}
> **Important:** The following properties must **not** be altered from default for use with Kong Manager:
* `logout_methods`
* `logout_query_arg`
* `logout_post_arg`

For detailed descriptions of each configuration property, learn more in the
[Session plugin documentation](/hub/kong-inc/session).

## Session security

The Session configuration is secure by default, so the cookie uses the
[Secure, HttpOnly](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Secure_and_HttpOnly_cookies),
and [SameSite](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#SameSite_cookies)
directives.

The following properties must be altered depending on the protocol and domains in use:
* If using HTTP instead of HTTPS: `"cookie_secure": false`
{% if_version lte:3.1.x %}
* If using different domains for the Admin API and Kong Manager: `"cookie_samesite": "off"`
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}
* If using different domains for the Admin API and Kong Manager: `"cookie_same_site": "Lax"`
{% endif_version %}

{:.important}
> **Important:** Sessions are not invalidated when a user logs out if `"storage": "cookie"` (the default) is used. In that case, the cookie is deleted client-side. Only when session data is stored server-side with `"storage": "kong"` set is the session actively invalidated.


## Example configurations

If using HTTPS and hosting Kong Manager and the Admin API from the same domain,
the following configuration could be used for Basic Auth:

```
enforce_rbac = on
admin_gui_auth = basic-auth
admin_gui_session_conf = {
    "cookie_name":"$4m04$",
    "secret":"change-this-secret",
    "storage":"kong"
}
```

In testing, if using HTTP, the following configuration could be used instead:

```
enforce_rbac = on
admin_gui_auth = basic-auth
admin_gui_session_conf = {
    "cookie_name":"04tm34l",
    "secret":"change-this-secret",
    "storage":"kong",
    "cookie_secure":false
}
```
