`kong.vaults.{name}.*`.

**Default:** `bundled`

{% if_version lte:3.1.x %}

### opentelemetry_tracing

Example: `0.25`, this should account for 25% of all traces.

**Default:** `1.0`

{% endif_version %}

### plugins

Comma-separated list of plugins this node should load. By default, only plugins
bundled in official distributions are loaded via the `bundled` keyword.

Loading a plugin does not enable it by default, but only instructs Kong to load
its source code, and allows to configure the plugin via the various related
Admin API endpoints.

The specified name(s) will be substituted as such in the Lua namespace:
`kong.plugins.{name}.*`.

When the `off` keyword is specified as the only value, no plugins will be
loaded.

`bundled` and plugin names can be mixed together, as the following examples
suggest:

- `plugins = bundled,custom-auth,custom-log` will include the bundled plugins
  plus two custom ones
- `plugins = custom-auth,custom-log` will *only* include the `custom-auth` and
  `custom-log` plugins.
- `plugins = off` will not include any plugins

**Note:** Kong will not start if some plugins were previously configured (i.e.

have rows in the database) and are not specified in this list. Before disabling
a plugin, ensure all instances of it are removed before restarting Kong.

**Note:** Limiting the amount of available plugins can improve P99 latency when
experiencing LRU churning in the database cache (i.e. when the configured
`mem_cache_size`) is full.

**Default:** `bundled`


### pluginserver_names

Comma-separated list of names for pluginserver processes. The actual names are
used for log messages and to relate the actual settings.

**Default:** none


### pluginserver_XXX_socket

Path to the unix socket used by the <XXX> pluginserver.

**Default:** `<prefix>/<XXX>.socket`


### pluginserver_XXX_start_cmd

Full command (including any needed arguments) to start the <XXX> pluginserver

**Default:** `/usr/local/bin/<XXX>`


### pluginserver_XXX_query_cmd

Full command to "query" the <XXX> pluginserver. Should produce a JSON with the
dump info of all plugins it manages

**Default:** `/usr/local/bin/query_<XXX>`


### port_maps

With this configuration parameter, you can let the Kong to know about the port
from which the packets are forwarded to it. This is fairly common when running
Kong in a containerized or virtualized environment.

For example, `port_maps=80:8000, 443:8443` instructs Kong that the port 80 is
mapped to 8000 (and the port 443 to 8443), where 8000 and 8443 are the ports
that Kong is listening to.

This parameter helps Kong set a proper forwarded upstream HTTP request header
or to get the proper forwarded port with the Kong PDK (in case other means
determining it has failed). It changes routing by a destination port to route by
a port from which packets are forwarded to Kong, and similarly it changes the
default plugin log serializer to use the port according to this mapping instead
of reporting the port Kong is listening to.

**Default:** none


### anonymous_reports

Send anonymous usage data such as error stack traces to help improve Kong.

**Default:** `on`

{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}
### proxy_server

Proxy server defined as a URL. Kong will only use this option if any component
is explictly configured to use proxy.

**Default:** none


### proxy_server_ssl_verify

Toggles server certificate verification if `proxy_server` is in HTTPS.

See the `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` setting to specify a certificate
authority.

**Default:** `off`
{% endif_version %}

---

{% if_version gte:3.3.x %}

### error_template_html

Path to the custom html error template to override the default html kong error
template.

The template is required to contain one single `%s` placeholder for the error
message, as in the following example:

```
<html>
   <body>
     <h1>My custom error template</h1>
     <p>%s.</p>
   </body>
</html>
```

Default: none

---

Path to the custom json error template to override the default json kong error
template.

Similarly to `error_template_html`, the template is required to contain one
single `%s` placeholder for the error message.

Path to the custom xml error template to override the default xml kong error
template

Similarly to `error_template_html`, the template is required to contain one
single `%s` placeholder for the error message.

Default: none

---

This is to prevent the cluster data plane table from growing indefinitely. The
default is set to 14 days. That is, if CP haven't heard from a DP for 14 days,
its entry will be removed.

**Default:** `1209600`


### cluster_ocsp

Whether to check for revocation status of DP certificates using OCSP (Online
Certificate Status Protocol).

If enabled, the DP certificate should contain the "Certificate Authority
Information Access" extension and the OCSP method with URI of which the OCSP
responder can be reached from CP.

OCSP checks are only performed on CP nodes, it has no effect on DP nodes.

Valid values to this setting are:

- `on`: OCSP revocation check is enabled and DP must pass the check in order to
  establish connection with CP.
- `off`: OCSP revocation check is disabled.
- `optional`: OCSP revocation check will be attempted, however, if the required
  extension is not found inside DP provided certificate or communication with
  the OCSP responder failed, then DP is still allowed through.

**Default:** `off`

---

## NGINX section

### proxy_listen

Comma-separated list of addresses and ports on which the proxy server should
listen for HTTP/HTTPS traffic.

The proxy server is the public entry point of Kong, which proxies traffic from
your consumers to your backend services. This value accepts IPv4, IPv6, and
hostnames.

Some suffixes can be specified for each pair:

- `ssl` will require that all connections made through a particular
  address/port be made with TLS enabled.
- `http2` will allow for clients to open HTTP/2 connections to Kong's proxy
  server.
- `proxy_protocol` will enable usage of the PROXY protocol for a given
  address/port.
- `deferred` instructs to use a deferred accept on Linux (the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT
  socket option).
- `bind` instructs to make a separate bind() call for a given address:port
  pair.
- `reuseport` instructs to create an individual listening socket for each
  worker process allowing the Kernel to better distribute incoming connections
  between worker processes
- `backlog=N` sets the maximum length for the queue of pending TCP connections.
  This number should not be too small in order to prevent clients seeing
  "Connection refused" error connecting to a busy Kong instance. **Note:** on
  Linux, this value is limited by the setting of `net.core.somaxconn` Kernel
  parameter. In order for the larger `backlog` set here to take effect it is
  necessary to raise `net.core.somaxconn` at the same time to match or exceed
  the `backlog` number set.
- `ipv6only=on|off` whether an IPv6 socket listening on a wildcard address [::]
  will accept only IPv6 connections or both IPv6 and IPv4 connections
- `so_keepalive=on|off|[keepidle]:[keepintvl]:[keepcnt]` configures the
  `TCP keepalive` behavior for the listening socket. If this parameter is
  omitted then the operating system’s settings will be in effect for the socket.
  If it is set to the value `on`, the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option is turned
  on for the socket. If it is set to the value `off`, the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option
  is turned off for the socket. Some operating systems support setting of
  TCP keepalive parameters on a per-socket basis using the `TCP_KEEPIDLE`,
  `TCP_KEEPINTVL`, and `TCP_KEEPCNT` socket options.

This value can be set to `off`, thus disabling the HTTP/HTTPS proxy port for
this node.

If stream_listen is also set to `off`, this enables 'control-plane' mode for
this node (in which all traffic proxying capabilities are disabled). This node
can then be used only to configure a cluster of Kong nodes connected to the same
datastore.

Example: `proxy_listen = 0.0.0.0:443 ssl, 0.0.0.0:444 http2 ssl`

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#listen for a
description of the accepted formats for this and other `*_listen` values.

See https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/proxy-protocol/ for more
details about the `proxy_protocol` parameter.

Not all `*_listen` values accept all formats specified in nginx's
documentation.

**Default:** `0.0.0.0:8000 reuseport backlog=16384, 0.0.0.0:8443 http2 ssl reuseport backlog=16384`


### proxy_url

Kong Proxy URL

The lookup, or balancer, address for your Kong Proxy nodes.

This value is commonly used in a microservices or service-mesh oriented
architecture.

Accepted format (parts in parentheses are optional):

`<scheme>://<IP / HOSTNAME>(:<PORT>(/<PATH>))`

Examples:

- `<scheme>://<IP>:<PORT>` -> `proxy_url = http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- `SSL <scheme>://<HOSTNAME>` -> `proxy_url = https://proxy.domain.tld`
- `<scheme>://<HOSTNAME>/<PATH>` -> `proxy_url = http://dev-machine/dev-285`

By default, Kong Manager, and Kong Portal will use the window request host and
append the resolved listener port depending on the requested protocol.

**Default:** none


### stream_listen

Comma-separated list of addresses and ports on which the stream mode should
listen.

This value accepts IPv4, IPv6, and hostnames.

Some suffixes can be specified for each pair:

- `ssl` will require that all connections made through a particular
  address/port be made with TLS enabled.
- `proxy_protocol` will enable usage of the PROXY protocol for a given
  address/port.
- `bind` instructs to make a separate bind() call for a given address:port
  pair.
- `reuseport` instructs to create an individual listening socket for each
  worker process allowing the Kernel to better distribute incoming connections
  between worker processes
- `backlog=N` sets the maximum length for the queue of pending TCP connections.
  This number should not be too small in order to prevent clients seeing
  "Connection refused" error connecting to a busy Kong instance. **Note:** on
  Linux, this value is limited by the setting of `net.core.somaxconn` Kernel
  parameter. In order for the larger `backlog` set here to take effect it is
  necessary to raise `net.core.somaxconn` at the same time to match or exceed
  the `backlog` number set.
- `ipv6only=on|off` whether an IPv6 socket listening on a wildcard address [::]
  will accept only IPv6 connections or both IPv6 and IPv4 connections
- `so_keepalive=on|off|[keepidle]:[keepintvl]:[keepcnt]` configures the
  `TCP keepalive` behavior for the listening socket. If this parameter is
  omitted then the operating system’s settings will be in effect for the socket.
  If it is set to the value `on`, the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option is turned
  on for the socket. If it is set to the value `off`, the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option
  is turned off for the socket. Some operating systems support setting of
  TCP keepalive parameters on a per-socket basis using the `TCP_KEEPIDLE`,
  `TCP_KEEPINTVL`, and `TCP_KEEPCNT` socket options.

Examples:

```
stream_listen = 127.0.0.1:7000 reuseport backlog=16384
stream_listen = 0.0.0.0:989 reuseport backlog=65536, 0.0.0.0:20
stream_listen = [::1]:1234 backlog=16384
```

By default this value is set to `off`, thus disabling the stream proxy port for
this node.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/stream/ngx_stream_core_module.html#listen for a
description of the formats that Kong might accept in stream_listen.

**Default:** `off`


### admin_api_uri

Hierarchical part of a URI which is composed optionally of a host, port, and
path at which the Admin API accepts HTTP or HTTPS traffic. When this config is
disabled, Kong Manager will use the window protocol + host and append the
resolved admin_listen HTTP/HTTPS port.

**Default:** none


### admin_listen

Comma-separated list of addresses and ports on which the Admin interface should
listen.

The Admin interface is the API allowing you to configure and manage Kong.

Access to this interface should be *restricted* to Kong administrators *only*.
This value accepts IPv4, IPv6, and hostnames.

It is highly recommended to avoid exposing the Admin API to public
interface(s), by using values such as 0.0.0.0:8001

See
https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/production/running-kong/secure-admin-api/
for more information about how to secure your Admin API.

Some suffixes can be specified for each pair:

- `ssl` will require that all connections made through a particular
  address/port be made with TLS enabled.
- `http2` will allow for clients to open HTTP/2 connections to Kong's proxy
  server.
- `proxy_protocol` will enable usage of the PROXY protocol for a given
  address/port.
- `deferred` instructs to use a deferred accept on Linux (the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT
  socket option).
- `bind` instructs to make a separate bind() call for a given address:port
  pair.
- `reuseport` instructs to create an individual listening socket for each
  worker process allowing the Kernel to better distribute incoming connections
  between worker processes
- `backlog=N` sets the maximum length for the queue of pending TCP connections.
  This number should not be too small in order to prevent clients seeing
  "Connection refused" error connecting to a busy Kong instance. **Note:** on
  Linux, this value is limited by the setting of `net.core.somaxconn` Kernel
  parameter. In order for the larger `backlog` set here to take effect it is
  necessary to raise `net.core.somaxconn` at the same time to match or exceed
  the `backlog` number set.
- `ipv6only=on|off` whether an IPv6 socket listening on a wildcard address [::]
  will accept only IPv6 connections or both IPv6 and IPv4 connections
- `so_keepalive=on|off|[keepidle]:[keepintvl]:[keepcnt]` configures the
  `TCP keepalive` behavior for the listening socket. If this parameter is
  omitted then the operating system’s settings will be in effect for the socket.
  If it is set to the value `on`, the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option is turned
  on for the socket. If it is set to the value `off`, the `SO_KEEPALIVE` option
  is turned off for the socket. Some operating systems support setting of
  TCP keepalive parameters on a per-socket basis using the `TCP_KEEPIDLE`,
  `TCP_KEEPINTVL`, and `TCP_KEEPCNT` socket options.

This value can be set to `off`, thus disabling the Admin interface for this
node, enabling a 'data-plane' mode (without configuration capabilities) pulling
its configuration changes from the database.

Example: `admin_listen = 127.0.0.1:8444 http2 ssl`

**Default:** `127.0.0.1:8001 reuseport backlog=16384, 127.0.0.1:8444 http2 ssl reuseport backlog=16384`


### status_listen

Comma-separated list of addresses and ports on which the Status API should
listen.

The Status API is a read-only endpoint allowing monitoring tools to retrieve
metrics, healthiness, and other non-sensitive information of the current Kong
node.

The following suffix can be specified for each pair:

- `ssl` will require that all connections made through a particular
  address/port be made with TLS enabled.
{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}
- `http2` will allow for clients to open HTTP/2 connections to Kong's Status
API server.
{% endif_version %}

This value can be set to `off`, disabling the Status API for this node.

{% if_version lte:3.1.x %}
Example: `status_listen = 0.0.0.0:8100`
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}
Example: `status_listen = 0.0.0.0:8100 ssl http2`
{% endif_version %}

**Default:** `off`

{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}

### debug_listen
{:.badge .enterprise}

Comma-separated list of addresses and ports on which the Debug API should
listen.

The following suffix can be specified for each pair:

- `ssl` will require that all connections made through a particular
  address/port be made with TLS enabled.
- `http2` will allow for clients to open HTTP/2 connections to Kong's Debug API
  server.

This value can be set to `off`, disabling the Debug API for this node.

Example: `debug_listen = 0.0.0.0:8200 ssl http2`

**Default:** `off`

{% endif_version %}

### nginx_user

Defines user and group credentials used by worker processes. If group is
omitted, a group whose name equals that of user is used.

Example: `nginx_user = nginx www`

**Note**: If the `kong` user and the `kong` group are not available, the
default user and group credentials will be `nobody nobody`.

**Default:** `kong kong`


### nginx_worker_processes

Determines the number of worker processes spawned by Nginx.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#worker_processes for detailed
usage of the equivalent Nginx directive and a description of accepted values.

**Default:** `auto`


### nginx_daemon

Determines whether Nginx will run as a daemon or as a foreground process.
Mainly useful for development or when running Kong inside a Docker environment.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#daemon.

**Default:** `on`


### mem_cache_size

Size of each of the two in-memory caches for database entities. The accepted
units are `k` and `m`, with a minimum recommended value of a few MBs.

**Note**: As this option controls the size of two different cache entries, the
total memory Kong uses to cache entities might be double this value.

**Default:** `128m`


### ssl_cipher_suite

Defines the TLS ciphers served by Nginx.

Accepted values are `modern`, `intermediate`, `old`, `fips`, or `custom`.

See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS for detailed descriptions
of each cipher suite. `fips` cipher suites are as decribed in
https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/FIPS_mode_and_TLS.

**Default:** `intermediate`


### ssl_ciphers

Defines a custom list of TLS ciphers to be served by Nginx. This list must
conform to the pattern defined by `openssl ciphers`.

This value is ignored if `ssl_cipher_suite` is not `custom`.

**Default:** none


### ssl_protocols

Enables the specified protocols for client-side connections. The set of
supported protocol versions also depends on the version of OpenSSL Kong was
built with. This value is ignored if `ssl_cipher_suite` is not `custom`.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_protocols

**Default:** `TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3`


### ssl_prefer_server_ciphers

Specifies that server ciphers should be preferred over client ciphers when
using the SSLv3 and TLS protocols. This value is ignored if `ssl_cipher_suite`
is not `custom`.

See
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_prefer_server_ciphers

**Default:** `on`


### ssl_dhparam

Defines DH parameters for DHE ciphers from the predefined groups: `ffdhe2048`,
`ffdhe3072`, `ffdhe4096`, `ffdhe6144`, `ffdhe8192`, from the absolute path to a
parameters file, or directly from the parameters content.

This value is ignored if `ssl_cipher_suite` is `modern` or `intermediate`. The
reason is that `modern` has no ciphers that needs this, and `intermediate` uses
`ffdhe2048`.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_dhparam

**Default:** none


### ssl_session_tickets

Enables or disables session resumption through TLS session tickets. This has no
impact when used with TLSv1.3.

Kong enables this by default for performance reasons, but it has security
implications: https://github.com/mozilla/server-side-tls/issues/135

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_tickets

**Default:** `on`


### ssl_session_timeout

Specifies a time during which a client may reuse the session parameters. See
the rationale: https://github.com/mozilla/server-side-tls/issues/198

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_timeout

**Default:** `1d`

{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}

### ssl_session_cache_size

Sets the size of the caches that store session parameters

See https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_ssl_module.html#ssl_session_cache

**Default:** `10m`

{% endif_version %}

### ssl_cert

{% if_version lte:3.0.x %}
Comma-separated list of the absolute paths to the certificates for
`proxy_listen` values with TLS enabled.
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}
Comma-separated list of certificates for `proxy_listen` values with TLS
enabled.
{% endif_version %}

If more than one certificates are specified, it can be used to provide
alternate type of certificate (for example, ECC certificate) that will be served
to clients that supports them. Note to properly serve using ECC certificates, it
is recommended to also set `ssl_cipher_suite` to `modern` or `intermediate`.

Unless this option is explicitly set, Kong will auto-generate a pair of default
certificates (RSA + ECC) first time it starts up and use it for serving TLS
requests.

{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}
Certificates can be configured on this property with any of the following
values:
* absolute path to the certificate
* certificate content
* base64 encoded certificate content
{% endif_version %}

**Default:** none


### ssl_cert_key

If more than one certificate was specified for `ssl_cert`, then this option
should contain the corresponding key for all certificates provided in the same
order.

Unless this option is explicitly set, Kong will auto-generate a pair of default
private keys (RSA + ECC) first time it starts up and use it for serving TLS
requests.

{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}
Keys can be configured on this property with either of the following values:
* absolute path to the certificate key

### headers

Comma-separated list of headers Kong should inject in client responses.

Accepted values are:

- `Server`: Injects `Server: kong/x.y.z` on Kong-produced response (e.g. Admin
  API, rejected requests from auth plugin).
- `Via`: Injects `Via: kong/x.y.z` for successfully proxied requests.
- `X-Kong-Proxy-Latency`: Time taken (in milliseconds) by Kong to process a
  request and run all plugins before proxying the request upstream.
- `X-Kong-Response-Latency`: time taken (in millisecond) by Kong to produce a
  response in case of e.g. plugin short-circuiting the request, or in in case of
  an error.
- `X-Kong-Upstream-Latency`: Time taken (in milliseconds) by the upstream
  service to send response headers.
- `X-Kong-Admin-Latency`: Time taken (in milliseconds) by Kong to process an
  Admin API request.
- `X-Kong-Upstream-Status`: The HTTP status code returned by the upstream
  service. This is particularly useful for clients to distinguish upstream
  statuses if the response is rewritten by a plugin.
- `server_tokens`: Same as specifying both `Server` and `Via`.
- `latency_tokens`: Same as specifying `X-Kong-Proxy-Latency`,
  `X-Kong-Response-Latency`, `X-Kong-Admin-Latency` and
  `X-Kong-Upstream-Latency`

In addition to those, this value can be set to `off`, which prevents Kong from
injecting any of the above headers. Note that this does not prevent plugins from
injecting headers of their own.

Example: `headers = via, latency_tokens`

**Default:** `server_tokens, latency_tokens`


### trusted_ips

Defines trusted IP addresses blocks that are known to send correct
`X-Forwarded-*` headers.

Requests from trusted IPs make Kong forward their `X-Forwarded-*` headers
upstream.

Non-trusted requests make Kong insert its own `X-Forwarded-*` headers.

This property also sets the `set_real_ip_from` directive(s) in the Nginx
configuration. It accepts the same type of values (CIDR blocks) but as a
comma-separated list.

To trust *all* /!\ IPs, set this value to `0.0.0.0/0,::/0`.

If the special value `unix:` is specified, all UNIX-domain sockets will be
trusted.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html#set_real_ip_from
for examples of accepted values.

**Default:** none


### real_ip_header

Defines the request header field whose value will be used to replace the client
address.

This value sets the `ngx_http_realip_module` directive of the same name in the
Nginx configuration.

If this value receives `proxy_protocol`:

- at least one of the `proxy_listen` entries must have the `proxy_protocol`
  flag enabled.
- the `proxy_protocol` parameter will be appended to the `listen` directive of
  the Nginx template.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html#real_ip_header
for a description of this directive.

**Default:** `X-Real-IP`


### real_ip_recursive

This value sets the `ngx_http_realip_module` directive of the same name in the
Nginx configuration.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html#real_ip_recursive
for a description of this directive.

**Default:** `off`


### error_default_type

Default MIME type to use when the request `Accept` header is missing and Nginx
is returning an error for the request.

Accepted values are `text/plain`, `text/html`, `application/json`, and
`application/xml`.

**Default:** `text/plain`


### upstream_keepalive_pool_size

Sets the default size of the upstream keepalive connection pools.

Upstream keepalive connection pools are segmented by the `dst ip/dst port/SNI`
attributes of a connection.

A value of `0` will disable upstream keepalive connections by default, forcing
each upstream request to open a new connection.

**Default:** `60`


### upstream_keepalive_max_requests

Sets the default maximum number of requests than can be proxied upstream
through one keepalive connection.

After the maximum number of requests is reached, the connection will be closed.

A value of `0` will disable this behavior, and a keepalive connection can be
used to proxy an indefinite number of requests.

**Default:** `100`


### upstream_keepalive_idle_timeout

Sets the default timeout (in seconds) for which an upstream keepalive
connection should be kept open. When the timeout is reached while the connection
has not been reused, it will be closed.

A value of `0` will disable this behavior, and an idle keepalive connection may
be kept open indefinitely.

**Default:** `60`

{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}

### allow_debug_header

Enable the `Kong-Debug` header function.

If it is `on`, kong will add `Kong-Route-Id` `Kong-Route-Name`
`Kong-Service-Id` `Kong-Service-Name` debug headers to response when the client
request header `Kong-Debug: 1` is present.

**Default:** `off`

{% endif_version %}

## NGINX Injected Directives section

Nginx directives can be dynamically injected in the runtime nginx.conf file
without requiring a custom Nginx configuration template.

All configuration properties respecting the naming scheme
`nginx_<namespace>_<directive>` will result in `<directive>` being injected in
the Nginx configuration block corresponding to the property's `<namespace>`.

Example: `nginx_proxy_large_client_header_buffers = 8 24k`

Will inject the following directive in Kong's proxy `server {}` block:

`large_client_header_buffers 8 24k;`

The following namespaces are supported:

- `nginx_main_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's configuration
  `main` context.
- `nginx_events_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's `events {}`
  block.
- `nginx_http_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's `http {}` block.
- `nginx_proxy_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's proxy `server {}`
  block.
- `nginx_upstream_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's proxy `upstream
  {}` block.
- `nginx_admin_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's Admin API `server
  {}` block.
- `nginx_status_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's Status API
  `server {}` block (only effective if `status_listen` is enabled).
{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}
- `nginx_debug_<directive>` <span class="badge enterprise"></span>: 
Injects `<directive>` in Kong's Debug API `server {}` block (only effective 
if `debug_listen` is enabled).
{% endif_version %}
- `nginx_stream_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's stream module
  `stream {}` block (only effective if `stream_listen` is enabled).
- `nginx_sproxy_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's stream module
  `server {}` block (only effective if `stream_listen` is enabled).
- `nginx_supstream_<directive>`: Injects `<directive>` in Kong's stream module
  `upstream {}` block.

As with other configuration properties, Nginx directives can be injected via
environment variables when capitalized and prefixed with `KONG_`.

Example: `KONG_NGINX_HTTP_SSL_PROTOCOLS` -> `nginx_http_ssl_protocols`

Will inject the following directive in Kong's `http {}` block:

`ssl_protocols <value>;`

If different sets of protocols are desired between the proxy and Admin API
server, you may specify `nginx_proxy_ssl_protocols` and/or
`nginx_admin_ssl_protocols`, both of which taking precedence over the `http {}`
block.


### nginx_main_worker_rlimit_nofile

Changes the limit on the maximum number of open files for worker processes.

The special and default value of `auto` sets this value to `ulimit -n` with the
upper bound limited to 16384 as a measure to protect against excess memory use,
and the lower bound of 1024 as a good default.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#worker_rlimit_nofile

**Default:** `auto`


### nginx_events_worker_connections

Sets the maximum number of simultaneous connections that can be opened by a
worker process.

The special and default value of `auto` sets this value to `ulimit -n` with the
upper bound limited to 16384 as a measure to protect against excess memory use,
and the lower bound of 1024 as a good default.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#worker_connections

**Default:** `auto`


### nginx_http_client_header_buffer_size

Sets buffer size for reading the client request headers.

See
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_header_buffer_size

**Default:** `1k`


### nginx_http_large_client_header_buffers

Sets the maximum number and size of buffers used for reading large clients
requests headers.

See
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#large_client_header_buffers

**Default:** `4 8k`


### nginx_http_client_max_body_size

Defines the maximum request body size allowed by requests proxied by Kong,
specified in the Content-Length request header. If a request exceeds this limit,
Kong will respond with a 413 (Request Entity Too Large). Setting this value to 0
disables checking the request body size.

See
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size

**Default:** `0`


### nginx_admin_client_max_body_size

Defines the maximum request body size for Admin API.

**Default:** `10m`

{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}

### nginx_http_charset

Adds the specified charset to the “Content-Type” response header field. If
this charset is different from the charset specified in the source_charset
directive, a conversion is performed.

The parameter `off` cancels the addition of charset to the “Content-Type”
response header field.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_charset_module.html#charset

**Default:** `UTF-8`

{% endif_version %}


### nginx_http_client_body_buffer_size

Defines the buffer size for reading the request body. If the client request
body is larger than this value, the body will be buffered to disk. Note that
when the body is buffered to disk, Kong plugins that access or manipulate the
request body may not work, so it is advisable to set this value as high as
possible (e.g., set it as high as `client_max_body_size` to force request bodies
to be kept in memory). Do note that high-concurrency environments will require
significant memory allocations to process many concurrent large request bodies.

See
http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_buffer_size

**Default:** `8k`


### nginx_admin_client_body_buffer_size

Defines the buffer size for reading the request body on Admin API.

**Default:** `10m`


### nginx_http_lua_regex_match_limit

Global `MATCH_LIMIT` for PCRE regex matching. The default of `100000` should
ensure at worst any regex Kong executes could finish within roughly 2 seconds.

**Default:** `100000`

{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}

### nginx_http_lua_regex_cache_max_entries

Specifies the maximum number of entries allowed in the worker process level
compiled regex cache.

It is recommended to set it to at least (number of regex paths * 2) to avoid
high CPU usages.

**Default:** `8192`

{% endif_version %}

---

## Datastore section

Kong can run with a database to store coordinated data between Kong nodes in a
cluster, or without a database, where each node stores its information
independently in memory.

When using a database, Kong will store data for all its entities (such as
Routes, Services, Consumers, and Plugins) in a database, and
all Kong nodes belonging to the same cluster must connect themselves to the same
database.

When not using a database, Kong is said to be in "DB-less mode": it will keep
its entities in memory, and each node needs to have this data entered via a
declarative configuration file, which can be specified through the
`declarative_config` property, or via the Admin API using the `/config`
endpoint.

When using Postgres as the backend storage, you can optionally enable Kong to
serve read queries from a separate database instance.

When the number of proxies is large, this can greatly reduce the load on the
main Postgres instance and achieve better scalability. It may also reduce the
latency jitter if the Kong proxy node's latency to the main Postgres instance is
high.

The read-only Postgres instance only serves read queries and write queries
still goes to the main connection. The read-only Postgres instance can be
eventually consistent while replicating changes from the main instance.

At least the `pg_ro_host` config is needed to enable this feature.

By default, all other database config for the read-only connection are
inherited from the corresponding main connection config described above but may
be optionally overwritten explicitly using the `pg_ro_*` config below.


### database

Determines which of PostgreSQL or Cassandra this node will use as its
datastore.

Accepted values are `postgres`, `cassandra`, and `off`.

**Default:** `postgres`

**pg_ssl_version** | When using SSL between Kong and PostgreSQL, the version of TLS to use. Accepted values are `tlsv1_1`, `tlsv1_2`, `tlsv1_3`, or `any`. When `any` is set, the client negotiates the highest version with the server, which can't be lower than `tlsv1_1`. | `tlsv1_2`
**pg_ssl_required** | When `pg_ssl` is on this determines if TLS must be used between Kong and PostgreSQL. It aborts the connection if the server does not support SSL connections. | `off`
**pg_ssl_verify** | Toggles server certificate verification if `pg_ssl` is enabled. See the `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` setting to specify a certificate authority. | `off`
**pg_ssl_cert** | The absolute path to the PEM encoded client TLS certificate for the PostgreSQL connection. Mutual TLS authentication against PostgreSQL is only enabled if this value is set. | none
**pg_ssl_cert_key** | If `pg_ssl_cert` is set, the absolute path to the PEM encoded client TLS private key for the PostgreSQL connection. | none
**pg_max_concurrent_queries** | Sets the maximum number of concurrent queries that can be executing at any given time. This limit is enforced per worker process; the total number of concurrent queries for this node will be will be: `pg_max_concurrent_queries * nginx_worker_processes`. The default value of 0 removes this concurrency limitation. | `0`
**pg_semaphore_timeout** | Defines the timeout (in ms) after which PostgreSQL query semaphore resource acquisition attempts will fail. Such failures will generally result in the associated proxy or Admin API request failing with an HTTP 500 status code. Detailed discussion of this behavior is available in the online documentation. | `60000`
**pg_keepalive_timeout** | Specify the maximal idle timeout (in ms) for the postgres connections in the pool. If this value is set to 0 then the timeout interval is unlimited. If not specified this value will be same as `lua_socket_keepalive_timeout` | none
**pg_pool_size** | Specifies the size limit (in terms of connection count) for the Postgres server. Note that this connection pool is intended per Nginx worker rather than per Kong instance. If not specified, the default value is the same as `lua_socket_pool_size` | none
**pg_backlog** | If specified, this value will limit the total number of open connections to the Postgres server to `pg_pool_size`. If the connection pool is full, subsequent connect operations will be inserted in a queue with size equal to this option's value. If the number of queued connect operations reaches `pg_backlog`, exceeding connections will fail. If not specified, then number of open connections to the Postgres server is not limited. | none
**pg_ro_host** | Same as `pg_host`, but for the read-only connection. **Note:** Refer to the documentation section above for detailed usage. | none
**pg_ro_port** | Same as `pg_port`, but for the read-only connection. | `<pg_port>`

### declarative_config

The path to the declarative configuration file which holds the specification of
all entities (Routes, Services, Consumers, etc.) to be used when the `database`
is set to `off`.

Entities are stored in Kong's in-memory cache, so you must ensure that enough
memory is allocated to it via the `mem_cache_size` property. You must also
ensure that items in the cache never expire, which means that `db_cache_ttl`
should preserve its default value of 0.

If the Hybrid mode `role` is set to `data_plane` and there's no configuration
cache file, this configuration is used before connecting to the Control Plane
node as a user-controlled fallback.

**Default:** none


### declarative_config_string

The declarative configuration as a string

**Default:** none


### declarative_config_encryption_mode

Set encryption of the declarative config mapped file on filesystem.

`aes-256-gcm` = Use AES-256-GCM to encrypt `chacha20-poly1305` = Use
chacha20-poly1305 to encrypt `off` = does not encrypt

**Default:** `off`

{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}

### lmdb_environment_path

Directory where the LMDB database files used by DB-less and Hybrid mode to
store Kong configurations reside.

This path is relative under the Kong `prefix`.

**Default:** `dbless.lmdb`


### lmdb_map_size

Maximum size of the LMDB memory map, used to store the DB-less and Hybird mode
configurations. Default is 128m.

**Default:** `128m`

{% endif_version %}

---

## Datastore Cache section

In order to avoid unnecessary communication with the datastore, Kong caches
entities (such as APIs, Consumers, Credentials...) for a configurable period of
time. It also handles invalidations if such an entity is updated.

This section allows for configuring the behavior of Kong regarding the caching
of such configuration entities.


### db_update_frequency

Frequency (in seconds) at which to check for updated entities with the
datastore.

When a node creates, updates, or deletes an entity via the Admin API, other
nodes need to wait for the next poll (configured by this value) to eventually
purge the old cached entity and start using the new one.

**Default:** `5`


### db_update_propagation

Time (in seconds) taken for an entity in the datastore to be propagated to
replica nodes of another datacenter.

When in a distributed environment such as a multi-datacenter Cassandra cluster,
this value should be the maximum number of seconds taken by Cassandra to
propagate a row to other datacenters.

When set, this property will increase the time taken by Kong to propagate the
change of an entity.

Single-datacenter setups or PostgreSQL servers should suffer no such delays,
and this value can be safely set to 0.

**Default:** `0`


### db_cache_ttl

Time-to-live (in seconds) of an entity from the datastore when cached by this
node.

Database misses (no entity) are also cached according to this setting if you do
not configure `db_cache_neg_ttl`.

If set to 0 (default), such cached entities or misses never expire.

**Default:** `0`


### db_cache_neg_ttl

Time-to-live (in seconds) of a datastore miss (no entity).

If not specified (default), `db_cache_ttl` value will be used instead.

If set to 0, misses will never expire.

**Default:** none


### db_resurrect_ttl

Time (in seconds) for which stale entities from the datastore should be
resurrected for when they cannot be refreshed (e.g., the datastore is
unreachable). When this TTL expires, a new attempt to refresh the stale entities
will be made.

**Default:** `30`


### db_cache_warmup_entities

Entities to be pre-loaded from the datastore into the in-memory cache at Kong
start-up.

This speeds up the first access of endpoints that use the given entities.

When the `services` entity is configured for warmup, the DNS entries for values
in its `host` attribute are pre-resolved asynchronously as well.

Cache size set in `mem_cache_size` should be set to a value large enough to
hold all instances of the specified entities.

If the size is insufficient, Kong will log a warning.

**Default:** `services`


---

## DNS Resolver section

By default, the DNS resolver will use the standard configuration files
`/etc/hosts` and `/etc/resolv.conf`. The settings in the latter file will be
overridden by the environment variables `LOCALDOMAIN` and `RES_OPTIONS` if they
have been set.

Kong will resolve hostnames as either `SRV` or `A` records (in that order, and
`CNAME` records will be dereferenced in the process).

In case a name was resolved as an `SRV` record it will also override any given
port number by the `port` field contents received from the DNS server.

The DNS options `SEARCH` and `NDOTS` (from the `/etc/resolv.conf` file) will be
used to expand short names to fully qualified ones. So it will first try the
entire `SEARCH` list for the `SRV` type, if that fails it will try the `SEARCH`
list for `A`, etc.

For the duration of the `ttl`, the internal DNS resolver will loadbalance each
request it gets over the entries in the DNS record. For `SRV` records the
`weight` fields will be honored, but it will only use the lowest `priority`
field entries in the record.


### dns_resolver

Comma separated list of nameservers, each entry in `ip[:port]` format to be
used by Kong. If not specified the nameservers in the local `resolv.conf` file
will be used.

Port defaults to 53 if omitted. Accepts both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

**Default:** none


### dns_hostsfile

The hosts file to use. This file is read once and its content is static in
memory.

To read the file again after modifying it, Kong must be reloaded.

**Default:** `/etc/hosts`


### dns_order

The order in which to resolve different record types. The `LAST` type means the
type of the last successful lookup (for the specified name). The format is a
(case insensitive) comma separated list.

**Default:** `LAST,SRV,A,CNAME`


### dns_valid_ttl

By default, DNS records are cached using the TTL value of a response. If this
property receives a value (in seconds), it will override the TTL for all
records.

**Default:** none


### dns_stale_ttl

Defines, in seconds, how long a record will remain in cache past its TTL. This
value will be used while the new DNS record is fetched in the background.

Stale data will be used from expiry of a record until either the refresh query
completes, or the `dns_stale_ttl` number of seconds have passed.

**Default:** `4`


### dns_cache_size

Defines the maximum allowed number of DNS records stored in memory cache.

Least recently used DNS records are discarded from cache if it is full. Both
errors and data are cached, therefore a single name query can easily take up
10-15 slots.

**Default:** `10000`


### dns_not_found_ttl

TTL in seconds for empty DNS responses and "(3) name error" responses.

**Default:** `30`


### dns_error_ttl

TTL in seconds for error responses.

**Default:** `1`


### dns_no_sync

If enabled, then upon a cache-miss every request will trigger its own dns
query.

When disabled multiple requests for the same name/type will be synchronised to
a single query.

**Default:** `off`

---


## Vaults section

A secret is any sensitive piece of information required for API gateway
operations. Secrets may be part of the core Kong Gateway configuration, used in
plugins, or part of the configuration associated with APIs serviced by the
gateway.

Some of the most common types of secrets used by Kong Gateway include:

- Data store usernames and passwords, used with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Private X.509 certificates
- API keys

Sensitive plugin configuration fields are generally used for authentication,
hashing, signing, or encryption. Kong Gateway lets you store certain values in a
vault. Here are the vault specific configuration options.

---

### vault_env_prefix

Defines the environment variable vault's default prefix. For example if you
have all your secrets stored in environment variables prefixed with `SECRETS_`,
it can be configured here so that it isn't necessary to repeat them in Vault
references.

Default: none

---
{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}

### vault_aws_region
{:.badge .enterprise}
The AWS region your vault is located in.

Default: none

successfully connect to it.

Default: none

---

### vault_hcv_mount
{:.badge .enterprise}

The mount point.

Default: `secret`

---

### vault_hcv_kv
{:.badge .enterprise}


The secrets engine version. Accepts `v1` or `v2`.

Default: `v1`

---

### vault_hcv_token
{:.badge .enterprise}

A token string.

Default: none

---

### vault_hcv_auth_method
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the authentication mechanism when connecting to the Hashicorp Vault
service.

Accepted values are: `token`, or `kubernetes`.

Default: `token`

---

### vault_hcv_kube_role
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the HashiCorp Vault role for the Kubernetes service account of the
running pod. `vault_hcv_auth_method` must be set to `kubernetes` for this to
activate.

Default: none

---

{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines where the Kubernetes service account token should be read from the
pod's filesystem, if using a non-standard container platform setup.

Default: none

---
{% endif_version %}


## Tuning & Behavior section

### worker_consistency

Defines whether this node should rebuild its state synchronously or
asynchronously (the balancers and the router are rebuilt on updates that affects
them, e.g., updates to Routes, Services or Upstreams, via the Admin API or
loading a declarative configuration file). (This option is deprecated and will
be removed in future releases. The new default is `eventual`.)

Accepted values are:

- `strict`: the router will be rebuilt synchronously, causing incoming requests
  to be delayed until the rebuild is finished. (This option is deprecated and
  will be removed in future releases. The new default is `eventual`)
- `eventual`: the router will be rebuilt asynchronously via a recurring
  background job running every second inside of each worker.

Note that `strict` ensures that all workers of a given node will always proxy
requests with an identical router, but that increased long tail latency can be
observed if frequent Routes and Services updates are expected.

Using `eventual` will help preventing long tail latency issues in such cases,
but may cause workers to route requests differently for a short period of time
after Routes and Services updates.

**Default:** `eventual`


### worker_state_update_frequency

Defines, in seconds, how often the worker state changes are checked with a background job.
When a change is detected, a new router or balancer will be built, as needed.
Raising this value will decrease the load on database servers and result in less
jitter in proxy latency, but it might take more time to propagate changes to
each individual worker.

**Default:** `5`


### router_flavor

Selects the router implementation to use when performing request routing.
Incremental router rebuild is available when the flavor is set to either
`expressions` or `traditional_compatible` which could significantly shorten
rebuild time for large number of routes.

Accepted values are:

- `traditional_compatible`: the DSL based expression router engine will be used
  under the hood. However the router config interface will be the same as
  `traditional` and expressions are automatically generated at router build
  time. The `expression` field on the `Route` object is not visible.
- `expressions`: the DSL based expression router engine will be used under the
  hood. Traditional router config interface is not visible and you must write
  Router Expression manually and provide them in the `expression` field on the
  `Route` object.
- `traditional`: the pre-3.0 Router engine will be used. Config interface will
  be the same as pre-3.0 Kong and the `expression` field on the `Route` object
  is not visible.

Deprecation warning: In Kong 3.0, `traditional` mode should be avoided and only
be used in case `traditional_compatible` did not work as expected.

This flavor of router will be removed in the next major release of Kong.

**Default:** `traditional_compatible`
---

### lua_max_req_headers

Maximum number of request headers to parse by default.

This argument can be set to an integer between 1 and 1000.

When proxying the Kong sends all the request headers and this setting does not
have any effect. It is used to limit Kong and its plugins from reading too many
request headers.

Default: `100`

---


### lua_max_resp_headers

Maximum number of response headers to parse by default.

This argument can be set to an integer between 1 and 1000.

When proxying, Kong returns all the response headers and this setting does not
have any effect. It is used to limit Kong and its plugins from reading too many
response headers.

Default: `100`

---

### lua_max_uri_args

Maximum number of request uri arguments to parse by default.

This argument can be set to an integer between 1 and 1000.

When proxying, Kong sends all the request query arguments and this setting does
not have any effect.

It is used to limit Kong and its plugins from reading too many query arguments.

Default: `100`

---

### lua_max_post_args

Maximum number of request post arguments to parse by default.

This argument can be set to an integer between 1 and 1000.

When proxying, Kong sends all the request post arguments and this setting does
not have any effect.

It is used to limit Kong and its plugins from reading too many post arguments.

Default: `100`

---


## Miscellaneous section

Additional settings inherited from lua-nginx-module allowing for more
flexibility and advanced usage.

format.
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version lte:3.0.x %}
Comma-separated list of paths to certificate authority files for Lua cosockets
in PEM format.
{% endif_version %}

The special value `system` attempts to search for the "usual default" provided
by each distro, according to an arbitrary heuristic. In the current
implementation, The following pathnames will be tested in order, and the first
one found will be used:

- /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt (Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo)
- /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt (Fedora/RHEL 6)
- /etc/ssl/ca-bundle.pem (OpenSUSE)
- /etc/pki/tls/cacert.pem (OpenELEC)
- /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem (CentOS/RHEL 7)
- /etc/ssl/cert.pem (OpenBSD, Alpine)

`system` can be used by itself or in conjunction with other CA filepaths.

When `pg_ssl_verify` or `cassandra_ssl_verify` are enabled, these certificate
authority files will be used for verifying Kong's database connections.

{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}

Certificates can be configured on this property with any of the following
values:
* `system`
* absolute path to the certificate
* certificate content
* base64 encoded certificate content

{% endif_version %}

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_trusted_certificate

**Default:** `system`


### lua_ssl_verify_depth

Sets the verification depth in the server certificates chain used by Lua
cosockets, set by `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate`.

This includes the certificates configured for Kong's database connections.

If the maximum depth is reached before reaching the end of the chain,
verification will fail. This helps mitigate certificate based DoS attacks.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_verify_depth

**Default:** `1`


### lua_ssl_protocols

Defines the TLS versions supported when handshaking with OpenResty's TCP
cosocket APIs.

This affects connections made by Lua code, such as connections to the database
Kong uses, or when sending logs using a logging plugin. It does *not* affect
connections made to the upstream Service or from downstream clients.

**Default:** `TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3`


### lua_package_path

Sets the Lua module search path (LUA_PATH). Useful when developing or using
custom plugins not stored in the default search path.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path

**Default:** `./?.lua;./?/init.lua;`


### lua_package_cpath

Sets the Lua C module search path (LUA_CPATH).

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_cpath

**Default:** none


### lua_socket_pool_size

Specifies the size limit for every cosocket connection pool associated with
every remote server.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_socket_pool_size

**Default:** `30`


### enforce_rbac
{:.badge .enterprise}

Specifies whether Admin API RBAC is enforced.

Accepts one of `entity`, `both`, `on`, or `off`.

- `on`: only endpoint-level authorization is enforced.
- `entity`: entity-level authorization applies.
- `both`: enables both endpoint and entity-level authorization.
- `off`: disables both endpoint and entity-level authorization.

When enabled, Kong will deny requests to the Admin API when a nonexistent or
invalid RBAC authorization token is passed, or the RBAC user with which the
token is associated does not have permissions to access/modify the requested
resource.

**Default:** `off`


### rbac_auth_header
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the name of the HTTP request header from which the Admin API will
attempt to authenticate the RBAC user.

**Default:** `Kong-Admin-Token`


### event_hooks_enabled
{:.badge .enterprise}

When enabled, event hook entities represent a relationship between an event
(source and event) and an action (handler). Similar to web hooks, event hooks
can be used to communicate Kong Gateway service events. When a particular event
happens on a service, the event hook calls a URL with information about that
event. Event hook configurations differ depending on the handler. The events
that are triggered send associated data.

See: https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/admin-api/event-hooks/reference/

**Default:** `on`


### fips

Turn on FIPS mode; this mode is only available on a FIPS build.

When running Kong in a multi-node setup, `vitals` entails two separate meanings
depending on the node.

On a Proxy-only node, `vitals` determines whether to collect data for Vitals.

On an Admin-only node, `vitals` determines whether to display Vitals metrics
and visualizations on the dashboard.

**Default:** `on`

hostnames. Additionally, the suffix `tcp` can be specified; doing so will result
in Kong sending StatsD metrics via TCP instead of the UDP (default).

**Default:** none


### vitals_statsd_prefix
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the prefix value attached to all Vitals StatsD events. This prefix is
useful when writing metrics to a multi-tenant StatsD exporter or server.

### audit_log_record_ttl

Length, in seconds, of the TTL for audit log records. Records in the database
older than their TTL are automatically purged.

Example, 30 days: `30 * 24 * 60 * 60 = 2592000`

**Default:** `2592000`


### audit_log_signing_key

Defines the path to a private RSA signing key that can be used to insert a
signature of audit records, adjacent to the record. The corresponding public key
should be stored offline, and can be used the validate audit entries in the
future. If this value is undefined, no signature will be generated.

**Default:** none

## Granular Tracing section

{:.warning}
> **Deprecation warning**: Granular tracing is deprecated. This
means the feature will eventually be removed.

Our target for Granular tracing removal is the Kong Gateway 4.0 release.

Granular tracing offers a mechanism to expose metrics and detailed debug data
about the lifecycle of Kong in a human- or machine-consumable format.


### tracing
{:.badge .enterprise}

When enabled, Kong will generate granular debug data about various portions of
the request lifecycle, such as DB or DNS queries, plugin execution, core handler
timing, etc.

**Default:** `off`


### tracing_write_strategy
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines how Kong will write tracing data at the conclusion of the request. The
default option, `file`, writes a human-readable depiction of tracing data to a
configurable location on the node's file system. Other strategies write tracing
data as a JSON document to the configured endpoint. Valid entries for this
option are `file`, `file_raw`, `http`, `tcp`, `tls`, and `udp`.

**Default:** `file`


### tracing_write_endpoint
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the endpoint to which tracing data will be written.

- For the `file` and `file_raw` tracing write strategies, this value must be a
  valid location on the node's file system to which Kong must have write access.
- For the `tcp`, `tls`, and `udp` strategies, this value is defined as a string
  in the form of: `<HOST>:<PORT>`
- For the `http` strategy, this value is defined in the form of:
  `<scheme>://<IP / HOSTNAME>(:<PORT>(/<PATH>))`

Traces sent via HTTP are delivered via POST method with an `application/json`
Content-Type.

**Default:** none


### tracing_time_threshold
{:.badge .enterprise}

The minimum time, in microseconds, over which a trace must execute in order to
write the trace data to the configured endpoint. This configuration can be used
to lower the noise present in trace data by removing trace objects that are not
interesting from a timing perspective. The default value of `0` removes this
limitation, causing traces of any duration to be written.

**Default:** `0`


### tracing_types
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the types of traces that are written.

Trace types not defined in this list are ignored, regardless of their lifetime.
The default special value of `all` results in all trace types being written,
regardless of type.

The following trace types are included:

- `query`: trace the database query
- `legacy_query`: (deprecated) trace the database query with legacy DAO
- `router`: trace Kong routing the request; internal routing time
- `balancer`: trace the execution of the overall balancer phase
- `balancer.getPeer`: trace Kong selecting an upstream peer from the
  ring-balancer
- `balancer.toip`: trace balancer to resolve peer's host to IP
- `connect.toip`: trace cosocket to resolve target's host to IP
- `access.before`: trace the preprocessing of access phase, like parameter
  parsing, route matching, and balance preparation
- `access.after`: trace the postprocess of access phase, like balancer
  execution and internal variable assigning
- `cassandra_iterate`: trace Cassandra driver to paginate over results
- `plugin`: trace plugins phase handlers

**Default:** `all`


### tracing_debug_header
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the name of the HTTP request header that must be present in order to
generate traces within a request. Setting this value provides a mechanism to
selectively generate request traces at the client's request. Note that the value
of the header does not matter, only that the header is present in the request.
When this value is not set and tracing is enabled, Kong will generate trace data
for all requests flowing through the proxy and Admin API. Note that data from
certificate handling phases is not logged when this setting is enabled.

**Default:** none


### generate_trace_details
{:.badge .enterprise}

When enabled, Kong will write context- specific details into traces. Trace
details offer more data about the context of the trace. This can significantly
increase the size of trace reports. Note also that trace details may contain
potentially sensitive information, such as raw SQL queries; care should be taken
to store traces properly when this option is enabled.

**Default:** `off`


---

## Route Collision Detection/Prevention section

### route_validation_strategy
{:.badge .enterprise}

The strategy used to validate routes when creating or updating them.

Different strategies are available to tune how to enforce splitting traffic of
workspaces.

- `smart` is the default option and uses the algorithm described in
  https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/workspaces/
- `off` disables any check
- `path` enforces routes to comply with the pattern described in config
  enforce_route_path_pattern

**Default:** `smart`


### enforce_route_path_pattern
{:.badge .enterprise}

Specifies the Lua pattern which will be enforced on the `paths` attribute of a
Route object. You can also add a placeholder for the workspace in the pattern,
which will be rendered during runtime based on the workspace to which the
`route` belongs.

This setting is only relevant if `route_validation_strategy` is set to `path`.

Example For Pattern `/$(workspace)/v%d/.*` valid paths are:

1. `/group1/v1/` if route belongs to workspace `group1`.

2. `/group2/v1/some_path` if route belongs to workspace `group2`.

**Default:** none


---

## Database Encryption & Keyring Management section

When enabled, Kong will transparently encrypt sensitive fields, such as
Consumer credentials, TLS private keys, and RBAC user tokens, among others. A
full list of encrypted fields is available from the Kong Enterprise
documentation site.

Encrypted data is transparently decrypted before being displayed to the Admin
API or made available to plugins or core routing logic.

While this feature is GA, do note that we currently do not provide normal
semantic versioning compatibility guarantees on the keyring feature's APIs in
that Kong may make a breaking change to the feature in a minor version. Also
note that mis-management of keyring data may result in irrecoverable data loss.


### keyring_enabled
{:.badge .enterprise}

When enabled, Kong will encrypt sensitive field values before writing them to
the database, and subsuquently decrypt them when retrieving data for the Admin
API, Developer Portal, or proxy business logic. Symmetric encryption keys are
managed based on the strategy defined below.

**Default:** `off`


### keyring_strategy
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the strategy implementation by which Kong nodes will manage symmetric
encryption keys. Please see the Kong Enterprise documentation for a detailed
description of each strategies. Acceptable values for this option are 'cluster'
and 'vault'.

* public key content
* base64 encoded public key content
{% endif_version %}

**Default:** none


### keyring_blob_path
{:.badge .enterprise}

material.

This option is useful largely for development purposes.

**Default:** none


### keyring_vault_host
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the Vault host at which Kong will fetch the encryption material. This
value should be defined in the format:

`<scheme>://<IP / HOSTNAME>:<PORT>`

**Default:** none

Defines the names of the Vault v2 KV path at which symmetric keys are found.

**Default:** none


{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}

### keyring_vault_auth_method
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the authentication mechanism when connecting to the Hashicorp Vault
service.

Accepted values are: `token`, or `kubernetes`:

* `token`: Uses the static token defined in the `keyring_vault_token`
configuration property.

* `kubernetes`: Uses the Kubernetes authentication mechanism, with the running
pod's mapped service account, to assume the Hashicorp Vault role name that is
defined in the `keyring_vault_kube_role` configuration property.

**Default:** `token`

{% endif_version %}

### keyring_vault_token
{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines the token value used to communicate with the v2 KV Vault HTTP(S) API.

**Default:** none


{% if_version gte:3.1.x %}

{:.badge .enterprise}

Defines where the Kubernetes service account token should be read from the
pod's filesystem, if using a non-standard container platform setup.

**Default:** `/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token`

{% endif_version %}


### untrusted_lua

Controls loading of Lua functions from admin-supplied sources such as the Admin
API. LuaJIT bytecode loading is always disabled.

**Warning:** LuaJIT is not designed as a secure runtime for running malicious
code, therefore you should properly protect your Admin API endpoint even with
sandboxing enabled. The sandbox only provides protection against trivial
attackers or unintentional modification of the Kong global environment.

Accepted values are: `off`, `sandbox`, or `on`:

* `off`: Disallow loading of any arbitrary Lua functions. The `off` option
disables any functionality that runs arbitrary Lua code, including the
Serverless Functions plugins and any transformation plugin that allows custom
Lua functions.

* `sandbox`: Allow loading of Lua functions, but use a sandbox when executing
them. The sandboxed function has restricted access to the global environment and
only has access to standard Lua functions that will generally not cause harm to
the Kong Gateway node.

* `on`: Functions have unrestricted access to the global environment and can
load any Lua modules. This is similar to the behavior in Kong Gateway prior to
2.3.0.

The default `sandbox` environment does not allow importing other modules or
libraries, or executing anything at the OS level (for example, file read/write).
The global environment is also not accessible.

Examples of `untrusted_lua = sandbox` behavior:

* You can't access or change global values such as
`kong.configuration.pg_password` * You can run harmless lua: `local foo = 1 +
1`. However, OS level functions are not allowed, like: `os.execute('rm -rf
/*')`.

For a full allowed/disallowed list, see:
https://github.com/kikito/sandbox.lua/blob/master/sandbox.lua

To customize the sandbox environment, use the `untrusted_lua_sandbox_requires`
and `untrusted_lua_sandbox_environment` parameters below.

**Default:** `sandbox`


### untrusted_lua_sandbox_requires

Comma-separated list of modules allowed to be loaded with `require` inside the
sandboxed environment. Ignored if `untrusted_lua` is not `sandbox`.

For example, say you have configured the Serverless pre-function plugin and it
contains the following `requires`:

```
local template = require "resty.template"
local split = require "kong.tools.utils".split
```

To run the plugin, add the modules to the allowed list:

```
untrusted_lua_sandbox_requires = resty.template, kong.tools.utils
```

**Warning:** Allowing certain modules may create opportunities to escape the
sandbox. For example, allowing `os` or `luaposix` may be unsafe.

**Default:** none


### untrusted_lua_sandbox_environment
{:.badge .enterprise}

Comma-separated list of global Lua variables that should be made available
inside the sandboxed environment. Ignored if `untrusted_lua` is not `sandbox`.

**Warning**: Certain variables, when made available, may create opportunities
to escape the sandbox.

**Default:** none


### openresty_path

Path to the OpenResty installation that Kong will use. When this is empty (the
default), Kong determines the OpenResty installation by searching for a
system-installed OpenResty and falling back to searching $PATH for the nginx
binary.

Setting this attribute disables the search behavior and explicitly instructs
Kong which OpenResty installation to use.

**Default:** none
{% if_version gte:3.3.x %}
---

### node_id
{:.badge .enterprise}

Node ID for the Kong node. Every Kong node in a Kong cluster must have a unique
and valid UUID. When empty, node ID is automatically generated.

Default: none

---

### cluster_fallback_config_import
{:.badge .enterprise}

Enable fallback configuration imports

This should only be enabled for data plane

Default: `off`

---
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version gte:3.2.x %}

### cluster_fallback_config_import
{:.badge .enterprise}

Enable fallback configuration imports

This should only be enabled for data plane

**Default:** `off`


### cluster_fallback_config_storage
{:.badge .enterprise}

Storage definition used by `cluster_fallback_config_import` and
`cluster_fallback_config_export`

Currently supported storage type: S3-like storages and GCP storage service.

To use S3 with a bucket named b and place all configs to with a key prefix
named p, set it to: s3://b/p To use GCP for the same bucket and prefix, set it
to: gcs://b/p

The credentials (and endpoint URL for S3-like) for S3 are passing with
environment variables: `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and
`AWS_CONFIG_STORAGE_ENDPOINT` (extension), where `AWS_CONFIG_STORAGE_ENDPOINT`
is the endpoint that hosts S3-like storage.

The credentials for GCP is provided via the environment variable
`GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`

**Default:** none


### cluster_fallback_config_export
{:.badge .enterprise}

Enable fallback configuration exports.

**Default:** `off`


### cluster_fallback_config_export_delay
{:.badge .enterprise}

The fallback configuration export interval.

If it's set to 60 and configuration A is exported and there're new
configurations B, C and D in the next 60 seconds, it will wait until 60 seconds
passed and export D, skipping B and C.

**Default:** `60`


### max_queued_batches

Maximum number of batches to keep on an internal plugin queue before dropping
old batches. This is meant as a global, last-resort control to prevent queues
from consuming infinite memory. When batches are being dropped, an error message
"exceeded max_queued_batches (%d), dropping oldest" will be logged. The error
message will also include a string that identifies the plugin causing the
problem. Queues are used by the http-log, statsd, opentelemetry and datadog
plugins.

**Default:** `100`
