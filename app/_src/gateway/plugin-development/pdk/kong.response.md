Client response module.

 The downstream response module contains a set of functions for producing and
 manipulating responses sent back to the client (downstream). Responses can
 be produced by Kong (for example, an authentication plugin rejecting a
 request), or proxied back from an Service's response body.

 Unlike `kong.service.response`, this module allows mutating the response
 before sending it back to the client.




## kong.response.get_status()

Returns the HTTP status code currently set for the downstream response (as
 a Lua number).

 If the request was proxied (as per `kong.response.get_source()`), the
 return value is the response from the Service (identical to
 `kong.service.response.get_status()`).

 If the request was _not_ proxied and the response was produced by Kong
 itself (i.e. via `kong.response.exit()`), the return value is
 returned as-is.


**Phases**

* header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `number`:  status The HTTP status code currently set for the
 downstream response.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.response.get_status() -- 200
```



## kong.response.get_header(name)

Returns the value of the specified response header, as would be seen by
 the client once received.

 The list of headers returned by this function can consist of both response
 headers from the proxied Service _and_ headers added by Kong (e.g. via
 `kong.response.add_header()`).

 The return value is either a `string`, or can be `nil` if a header with
 `name` is not found in the response. If a header with the same name is
 present multiple times in the request, this function returns the value
 of the first occurrence of this header.


**Phases**

* header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **name** (`string`):  The name of the header.

 Header names are case-insensitive and dashes (`-`) can be written as
 underscores (`_`). For example, the header `X-Custom-Header` can also be
 retrieved as `x_custom_header`.


**Returns**

* `string|nil`:  The value of the header.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a response with the following headers:
-- X-Custom-Header: bla
-- X-Another: foo bar
-- X-Another: baz

kong.response.get_header("x-custom-header") -- "bla"
kong.response.get_header("X-Another")       -- "foo bar"
kong.response.get_header("X-None")          -- nil
```



## kong.response.get_headers([max_headers])

Returns a Lua table holding the response headers.  Keys are header names.
 Values are either a string with the header value, or an array of strings
 if a header was sent multiple times. Header names in this table are
 case-insensitive and are normalized to lowercase, and dashes (`-`) can be
 written as underscores (`_`). For example, the header `X-Custom-Header` can
 also be retrieved as `x_custom_header`.

 A response initially has no headers. Headers are added when a plugin
 short-circuits the proxying by producing a header
 (e.g. an authentication plugin rejecting a request), or if the request has
 been proxied, and one of the latter execution phases is currently running.

 Unlike `kong.service.response.get_headers()`, this function returns *all*
 headers as the client would see them upon reception, including headers
 added by Kong itself.

{% if_version lte:3.2.x %}
 By default, this function returns up to **100** headers. The optional
 `max_headers` argument can be specified to customize this limit, but must
 be greater than **1** and equal to or less than **1000**.
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte:3.3.x %}
 By default, this function returns up to **100** headers (or what has been
 configured using `lua_max_resp_headers`). The optional `max_headers` argument
 can be specified to customize this limit, but must be greater than **1** and
 equal to or less than **1000**.
{% endif_version %}


**Phases**

* header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **max_headers** (`number`, _optional_):  Limits the number of headers parsed.

**Returns**

1.  `table`:   headers A table representation of the headers in the
 response.


1.  `string`:  err If more headers than `max_headers` were present,
 returns a string with the error `"truncated"`.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given an response from the Service with the following headers:
-- X-Custom-Header: bla
-- X-Another: foo bar
-- X-Another: baz

local headers = kong.response.get_headers()

headers.x_custom_header -- "bla"
headers.x_another[1]    -- "foo bar"
headers["X-Another"][2] -- "baz"
```



## kong.response.get_source()

This function helps determine where the current response originated
 from.  Since Kong is a reverse proxy, it can short-circuit a request and
 produce a response of its own, or the response can come from the proxied
 Service.

 Returns a string with three possible values:

 * `"exit"` is returned when, at some point during the processing of the
   request, there has been a call to `kong.response.exit()`. This happens
   when the request was short-circuited by a plugin or by Kong
   itself (e.g. invalid credentials).
 * `"error"` is returned when an error has happened while processing the
   request. For example, a timeout while connecting to the upstream
   service.
 * `"service"` is returned when the response was originated by successfully
   contacting the proxied Service.


**Phases**

* header_filter, response, body_filter, log, admin_api

**Returns**

* `string`:  The source.


**Usage**

``` lua
if kong.response.get_source() == "service" then
  kong.log("The response comes from the Service")
elseif kong.response.get_source() == "error" then
  kong.log("There was an error while processing the request")
elseif kong.response.get_source() == "exit" then
  kong.log("There was an early exit while processing the request")
end
```



## kong.response.set_status(status)

Allows changing the downstream response HTTP status code before sending it
 to the client.

**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **status** (`number`):  The new status.

**Returns**

*  Nothing; throws an error on invalid input.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.response.set_status(404)
```



## kong.response.set_header(name, value)

Sets a response header with the given value.  This function overrides any
 existing header with the same name.

 Note: Underscores in header names are automatically transformed into dashes
 by default. If you want to deactivate this behavior, set the
 `lua_transform_underscores_in_response_headers` Nginx config option to `off`.

 This setting can be set in the Kong Config file:

     nginx_http_lua_transform_underscores_in_response_headers = off

 Be aware that changing this setting might break any plugins that
 rely on the automatic underscore conversion.
 You cannot set Transfer-Encoding header with this function. It will be ignored.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **name** (`string`):  The name of the header
* **value** (`string|number|boolean`):  The new value for the header.

**Returns**

*  Nothing; throws an error on invalid input.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.response.set_header("X-Foo", "value")
```



## kong.response.add_header(name, value)

Adds a response header with the given value.  Unlike
 `kong.response.set_header()`, this function does not remove any existing
 header with the same name. Instead, another header with the same name is
 added to the response. If no header with this name already exists on
 the response, then it is added with the given value, similarly to
 `kong.response.set_header().`


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **name** (`string`):  The header name.
* **value** (`string|number|boolean`):  The header value.

**Returns**

*  Nothing; throws an error on invalid input.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.response.add_header("Cache-Control", "no-cache")
kong.response.add_header("Cache-Control", "no-store")
```



## kong.response.clear_header(name)

Removes all occurrences of the specified header in the response sent to
 the client.

**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **name** (`string`):  The name of the header to be cleared

**Returns**

*  Nothing; throws an error on invalid input.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.response.set_header("X-Foo", "foo")
kong.response.add_header("X-Foo", "bar")

kong.response.clear_header("X-Foo")
-- from here onwards, no X-Foo headers will exist in the response
```



## kong.response.set_headers(headers)

Sets the headers for the response.  Unlike `kong.response.set_header()`,
 the `headers` argument must be a table in which each key is a string
 corresponding to a header's name, and each value is a string, or an
 array of strings.

 The resulting headers are produced in lexicographical order. The order of
 entries with the same name (when values are given as an array) is
 retained.

 This function overrides any existing header bearing the same name as those
 specified in the `headers` argument. Other headers remain unchanged.

 You cannot set Transfer-Encoding header with this function. It will be ignored.


**Phases**

* rewrite, access, header_filter, response, admin_api

**Parameters**

* **headers** (`table`):

**Returns**

*  Nothing; throws an error on invalid input.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.response.set_headers({
  ["Bla"] = "boo",
  ["X-Foo"] = "foo3",
  ["Cache-Control"] = { "no-store", "no-cache" }
})

-- Will add the following headers to the response, in this order:
-- X-Bar: bar1
-- Bla: boo
-- Cache-Control: no-store
-- Cache-Control: no-cache
-- X-Foo: foo3
```



## kong.response.get_raw_body()

Returns the full body when the last chunk has been read.

 Calling this function starts buffering the body in
 an internal request context variable, and sets the current
 chunk (`ngx.arg[1]`) to `nil` when the chunk is not the
 last one. When it reads the last chunk, the function returns the full
 buffered body.


**Phases**

* `body_filter`

**Returns**

* `string`:  body The full body when the last chunk has been read,
                      otherwise returns `nil`.


**Usage**

``` lua
local body = kong.response.get_raw_body()
if body then
  body = transform(body)
  kong.response.set_raw_body(body)
end
```



## kong.response.set_raw_body(body)

Sets the body of the response.

 The `body` argument must be a string and is not processed in any way.
 This function can't change the `Content-Length` header if one was
 added. If you decide to use this function, the `Content-Length` header
 should also be cleared, for example in the `header_filter` phase.


**Phases**

* `body_filter`

**Parameters**

* **body** (`string`):  The raw body.

**Returns**

*  Nothing; throws an error on invalid inputs.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.response.set_raw_body("Hello, world!")
-- or
local body = kong.response.get_raw_body()
if body then
  body = transform(body)
  kong.response.set_raw_body(body)
end
```



## kong.response.exit(status[, body[, headers]])

This function interrupts the current processing and produces a response.
 It is typical to see plugins using it to produce a response before Kong
 has a chance to proxy the request (e.g. an authentication plugin rejecting
 a request, or a caching plugin serving a cached response).

 It is recommended to use this function in conjunction with the `return`
 operator, to better reflect its meaning:

 ```lua
 return kong.response.exit(200, "Success")
 ```

 Calling `kong.response.exit()` interrupts the execution flow of
 plugins in the current phase. Subsequent phases will still be invoked.
 For example, if a plugin calls `kong.response.exit()` in the `access`
 phase, no other plugin is executed in that phase, but the
 `header_filter`, `body_filter`, and `log` phases are still executed,
 along with their plugins. Plugins should be programmed defensively
 against cases when a request is **not** proxied to the Service, but
 instead is produced by Kong itself.

 1. The first argument `status` sets the status code of the response that
 is seen by the client.

    In L4 proxy mode, the `status` code provided is primarily for logging
    and statistical purposes, and is not visible to the client directly.
    In this mode, only the following status codes are supported:

    * 200 - OK
    * 400 - Bad request
    * 403 - Forbidden
    * 500 - Internal server error
    * 502 - Bad gateway
    * 503 - Service unavailable

 2. The second, optional, `body` argument sets the response body. If it is
    a string, no special processing is done, and the body is sent
    as-is.  It is the caller's responsibility to set the appropriate
    `Content-Type` header via the third argument.

    As a convenience, `body` can be specified as a table. In that case,
    the `body` is JSON-encoded and has the `application/json` Content-Type
    header set.

    On gRPC, we cannot send the `body` with this function, so
    it sends `"body"` in the `grpc-message` header instead.
    * If the body is a table, it looks for the `message` field in the body,
    and uses that as a `grpc-message` header.
    * If you specify `application/grpc` in the `Content-Type` header, the
    body is sent without needing the `grpc-message` header.

    In L4 proxy mode, `body` can only be `nil` or a string. Automatic JSON
    encoding is not available. When `body` is provided, depending on the
    value of `status`, the following happens:

    * When `status` is 500, 502 or 503, then `body` is logged in the Kong
    error log file.
    * When the `status` is anything else, `body` is sent back to the L4 client.

 3. The third, optional, `headers` argument can be a table specifying
    response headers to send. If specified, its behavior is similar to
    `kong.response.set_headers()`. This argument is ignored in L4 proxy mode.

 Unless manually specified, this method automatically sets the
 `Content-Length` header in the produced response for convenience.

**Phases**

* preread, rewrite, access, admin_api, header_filter (only if `body` is nil)

**Parameters**

* **status** (`number`):  The status to be used.
* **body** (`table|string`, _optional_):  The body to be used.
* **headers** (`table`, _optional_):  The headers to be used.

**Returns**

*  Nothing; throws an error on invalid input.


**Usage**

``` lua
return kong.response.exit(403, "Access Forbidden", {
  ["Content-Type"] = "text/plain",
  ["WWW-Authenticate"] = "Basic"
})

---

return kong.response.exit(403, [[{"message":"Access Forbidden"}]], {
  ["Content-Type"] = "application/json",
  ["WWW-Authenticate"] = "Basic"
})

---

return kong.response.exit(403, { message = "Access Forbidden" }, {
  ["WWW-Authenticate"] = "Basic"
})

---

-- In L4 proxy mode
return kong.response.exit(200, "Success")
```



## kong.response.error(status[, message[, headers]])

This function interrupts the current processing and produces an error
 response.

 It is recommended to use this function in conjunction with the `return`
 operator, to better reflect its meaning:

 ```lua
 return kong.response.error(500, "Error", {["Content-Type"] = "text/html"})
 ```

 1. The `status` argument sets the status code of the response that
 is seen by the client. The status code must an error code, that is,
 greater than 399.

 2. The optional `message` argument sets the message describing
 the error, which is written in the body.

 3. The optional `headers` argument can be a table specifying response
 headers to send. If specified, its behavior is similar to
 `kong.response.set_headers()`.

   This method sends the response formatted in JSON, XML, HTML or plaintext.
   The actual format is determined using one of the following options, in
   this order:
   - Manually specified in the `headers` argument using the `Content-Type`
   header.
   - Conforming to the `Accept` header from the request.
   - If there is no setting in the `Content-Type` or `Accept` header, the
   response defaults to JSON format. Also see the `Content-Length`
   header in the produced response for convenience.

**Phases**

* rewrite, access, admin_api, header_filter (only if `body` is nil)

**Parameters**

* **status** (`number`):  The status to be used (>399).
* **message** (`string`, _optional_):  The error message to be used.
* **headers** (`table`, _optional_):  The headers to be used.

**Returns**

*  Nothing; throws an error on invalid input.


**Usage**

``` lua
return kong.response.error(403, "Access Forbidden", {
  ["Content-Type"] = "text/plain",
  ["WWW-Authenticate"] = "Basic"
})

---

return kong.response.error(403, "Access Forbidden")

---

return kong.response.error(403)
```
