This tutorial will walk you through all the steps to build a new custom plugin for {{site.base_gateway}}.
The plugin you build will transform HTTP traffic as it passes through the API gateway, and give you
a solid starting point for building custom plugins to solve your specific business needs.

The guide starts by setting up a new plugin project, showing how folders are structured and explaining 
code file contents and best practices. The guide proceeds by describing testing tools and how to 
build automated tests for your custom plugins. The guide continues by showing how to add 
plugin configuration to the project allowing for runtime behavior changes.

Later chapters of the guide go further to provide guidance on advanced topics including 
consuming external services from within your plugin and plugin deployments.
