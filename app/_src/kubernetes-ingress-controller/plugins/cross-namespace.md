title: Using plugins across namespaces
type: how-to
purpose: |
  Configure plugins in one namespace that interact with resources in another.
---

Plugins can interact with resources across different Kubernetes namespaces.
_KongClusterPlugin_ resources create plugins available for resources in any
namespace, but require cluster-level permissions and may not be appropriate for
all environments. This guide covers the use of _ReferenceGrant_ resources to
grant selective permissions to allow _KongPlugin_ resources in one namespace to
modify resources in another.

> **Note**: This guide requires {{site.kic_product_name}} version 3.2 or higher
> and the [_ReferenceGrant_](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/api-types/referencegrant/)
> resource definition from the [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/).
> _ReferenceGrant_ may not be available on all Kubernetes clusters. 

## Example use case

Kim manages [consumers](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/{{page.release}}/reference/custom-resources/#kongconsumer)
for Example Organization. They have permission to the `qyzylorda` namespace and
creates consumers and credentials in it.

Luka manages Example Organization's `httpbin` Service in the `kualalumpur`
namespace. Luka wants to apply different rate limits to different consumers,
but they do not have full access to the `qyzylorda` namespace, and Kim does not
have access to the `kualalumpur` namespace. To manage these limits, Kim can
create _ReferenceGrants_ that permit Luka's _KongPlugins_ in `kualalumpur` to
interact with _KongConsumers_ in `qyzylorda` namespace.

## Create the test environment

Install [{{site.kic_product_name}} and the Gateway APIs](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/{{page.release}}/get-started/).

{:.note}
> This guide requires the Gateway API _ReferenceGrant_ resource, which
> is not available by default on all Kubernetes clusters.
> {{site.kic_product_name}} does support cross-namespace plugin configuration
> with the older Ingress API if ReferenceGrant is installed. This guide only
> demonstrates use of the Gateway API's HTTPRoute resource, but is generally
> applicable to Ingress as well. Example cross-namespace configuration in this
> guide interacts with Service and KongConsumer resources to be routing
> API-agnostic.

## Create namespaces

Create the two test namespaces:

```bash
kubectl create namespace qyzylorda
kubectl create namespace kualalumpur
```

The result should look like:

```text
namespace/qyzylorda created
namespace/kualalumpur created
```

## Create routes and services

Create a Service and Deployment in `kualalumpur`:

```bash
kubectl create -f https://docs.konghq.com/assets/kubernetes-ingress-controller/examples/httpbin-service.yaml -n kualalumpur
```

The result should look like:

```text
service/httpbin created
deployment.apps/httpbin created
```

Create an HTTPRoute to access the Service:

```bash
echo "
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: bintang
  annotations:
    konghq.com/strip-path: 'true'
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: kong
    namespace: default
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /bintang
    backendRefs:
    - name: httpbin
      kind: Service
      port: 80
" | kubectl apply -n kualalumpur -f -
```

The result should look like:
```text
httproute.gateway.networking.k8s.io/bintang created
```

Create a authentication plugin:

```bash
echo '
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1
kind: KongPlugin
metadata:
  name: httpbin-basic-auth
config:
  hide_credentials: true
plugin: basic-auth
' | kubectl apply -n kualalumpur -f -
```

The result should look like:
```text
kongplugin.configuration.konghq.com/httpbin-basic-auth created
``` 
and attach it to the Service:

```bash
kubectl annotate service httpbin -n kualalumpur konghq.com/plugins=httpbin-basic-auth
``` 

The result should look like:
```text
service/httpbin annotated
``` 

## Create consumers and credentials

1. Create Secrets to add `basic-auth` credentials for two consumers:

    ```bash
    echo '
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: aygerim-basic-auth
      labels:
        konghq.com/credential: basic-auth
    stringData:
        username: aygerim
        password: aygerim-password
    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: rustem-basic-auth
      labels:
        konghq.com/credential: basic-auth
    stringData:
        username: rustem
        password: rustem-password
    ' | kubectl apply -n qyzylorda -f -
    ```

    The results should look like:
    ```text
    secret/aygerim-basic-auth created
    secret/rustem-basic-auth created
    ```

1. Create consumers named `aygerim` and `rustem` that use these credentials:

{% include /md/kic/consumer.md release=page.release name='aygerim' credName='aygerim-basic-auth' namespace='qyzylorda' %}

{% include /md/kic/consumer.md release=page.release name='rustem' credName='rustem-basic-auth' namespace='qyzylorda' %}

## Grant cross-namespace permissions

Luka and Kim wants to limit the amount of requests to the `httpbin` Service on
a per-consumer basis.  Because they only have access to their own namespaces,
they need to create rules that allow interactions across them.

By default, resources that support the [`konghq.com/plugins` annotation](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/{{page.release}}/reference/annotations/#konghqcomplugins)
can only attach plugins in their same namespace. ReferenceGrant resources can
grant permission to use plugins to resources in other namespaces.

To allow this cross-namespace interaction, Kim asks Luka to create a
ReferenceGrant in `kualalumpur` that allows KongConsumers in `qyzylorda` to use
KongPlugins in `kualalumpur`:

```bash
echo '
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ReferenceGrant
metadata:
  name: qyzylorda-rate-limit
  namespace: kualalumpur
spec:
  from:
  - group: "configuration.konghq.com"
    kind: KongConsumer
    namespace: qyzylorda
  to:
  - group: "configuration.konghq.com"
    kind: KongPlugin
' | kubectl apply -f -
```

The results should look like:
```text
referencegrant.gateway.networking.k8s.io/qyzylorda-rate-limit created
```

Such ReferenceGrants allow the `from` resource (KongConsumers in the `qyzylorda`
namespace) to interact with KongPlugins in the ReferenceGrant's namespace
(`kualalumpur`).

## Create the cross-namespace plugins

With the ReferenceGrant in place, Luka can create the `rate-limiting`
KongPlugins:

```bash
echo '
---
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1
kind: KongPlugin
metadata:
  name: rate-limit-aygerim
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: kong
config:
  minute: 10
  policy: local
plugin: rate-limiting
---
apiVersion: configuration.konghq.com/v1
kind: KongPlugin
metadata:
  name: rate-limit-rustem
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: kong
config:
  minute: 5
  policy: local
plugin: rate-limiting
' | kubectl apply -f - -n kualalumpur
```

The result should look like:
```text
kongplugin.configuration.konghq.com/rate-limit-aygerim created
kongplugin.configuration.konghq.com/rate-limit-rustem created
``` 

## Attach the plugins to their resources

{:.note}

With the plugins in place, each namespace administrator can attach them to the
resources in their respective namespaces.

Kim attaches the plugins to the KongConsumers in `qyzylorda`. They use the
`<namespace>:<kongplugin-resource-name>` format in the plugin name to indicate
that the requested KongPlugin resides in another namespace:

```bash
kubectl annotate kongconsumer aygerim -n qyzylorda konghq.com/plugins=kualalumpur:rate-limit-aygerim
kubectl annotate kongconsumer rustem -n qyzylorda konghq.com/plugins=kualalumpur:rate-limit-rustem
``` 

The result should look like:

```text
kongconsumer.configuration.konghq.com/aygerim annotated
kongconsumer.configuration.konghq.com/rustem annotated
``` 

Luka attaches the plugins to the `httpbin` Service in `kualalumpur`:

```bash
kubectl annotate service httpbin --overwrite -n kualalumpur konghq.com/plugins=httpbin-basic-auth,rate-limit-aygerim,rate-limit-rustem
``` 

Note that this command overrides the entire plugin annotation, so it needs to
include the `httpbin-basic-auth` plugin from earlier in the list, not just the
new rate limiting plugins.

The result should look like:

```text
service/httpbin annotated
``` 

## Test the configuration

Send a request using the `aygerim` consumer:

```bash
curl -sv $PROXY_IP/bintang/status/200 -u aygerim:aygerim-password 2>&1 | grep "X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute"
```
The results should show the remaining limit expected for `aygerim`. Since
`aygerim` can send 10 requests per minute, and has sent 1, the response should
indicate there are 9 requests remaining:

```text
< X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute: 9
```

Send a request using the `rustem` consumer:

```bash
curl -sv $PROXY_IP/bintang/status/200 -u rustem:rustem-password 2>&1 | grep "X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute"
```
The results should show the remaining limit expected for `rustem`. Since
`rustem` can send 5 requests per minute, and has sent 1, the response should
indicate there are 4 requests remaining:

```text
< X-RateLimit-Remaining-Minute: 4
```
