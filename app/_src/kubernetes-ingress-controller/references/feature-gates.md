title: Feature Gates
---

Upstream [Kubernetes][k8s] includes [feature gates][gates], which enable or disable features with flags and track the maturity of a feature using [feature stages][stages]. Here in the {{site.kic_product_name}} (KIC), we use the same definitions of `feature gates` and `feature stages` from upstream Kubernetes to define our own list of features.

Using feature gates enables contributors to add and manage new (and potentially experimental) functionality to the KIC in a controlled manner. The features will be "hidden" until generally available (GA) and the progress and maturity of features on their path to GA will be documented. Feature gates also create a clear path for deprecating features.

See below for current features and their statuses, and follow the links to the relevant feature documentation:

* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)
* [Kubernetes feature gates](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/)
* [Feature stages](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/#feature-stages)

## Feature gates for alpha and beta features

Features that reach GA and become stable are removed from this table, but they can be found in the main [KIC CRD documentation][specs] and [guides][guides]. This table is an overview of features at various maturity levels:

| Feature                | Default | Stage | Since | Until |
|------------------------|---------|-------|-------|-------|
| Knative                | `false` | Alpha | 0.8.0 | TBD   |

{% if_version lte: 2.5.x %}
| Gateway                | `false` | Alpha | 2.2.0 | 2.5.0 |
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte: 2.6.x %}
| Gateway                | `true`  | Beta  | 2.6.0 | TBD   |
| GatewayAlpha           | `false` | Alpha | 2.6.0 | TBD   |
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version lte: 2.7.x %}
| CombinedRoutes         | `false` | Alpha | 2.4.0 | TBD   |
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte: 2.8.x %}
| CombinedRoutes         | `true`  | Beta  | 2.8.0 | TBD   |
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte: 2.10.x %}
| ExpressionRoutes       | `false` | Alpha | 2.10.0 | TBD   |
| CombinedServices       | `false` | Alpha | 2.10.0 | TBD   |
| FillIDs                | `false` | Alpha | 2.10.0 | 3.0   |
{% endif_version %}

### Feature gates details

* The **since** and **until** rows in the table refer to [KIC Releases][releases].
* Most features will be planned using [Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals (KEP)][k8s-keps]. If you're interested in developing features, familiarize yourself with our [KEPs][kic-keps].
* Features that are currently in alpha or beta states may become deprecated at any time. Deprecated features are removed during the next minor release.
* Until a feature becomes GA, there are no guarantees that it's going to continue being available. For more information, see the [changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

>**Important:** To avoid disruption to your services consider not using features until they have reached GA status. 

### Using feature gates

To enable feature gates, provide the `--feature-gates` flag when launching KIC, or set the `CONTROLLER_FEATURE_GATES` environment variable.

Feature gates consist of a comma-delimited set of `key=value` pairs. For example, if you wanted to enable `CombinedRoutes` and `CombinedServices`, you'd set `CONTROLLER_FEATURE_GATES=CombinedRoutes=true,CombinedServices=true`.

To enable features via Helm, set the following in your `values.yaml`:

```yaml
ingressController:
  env:
    feature_gates: CombinedRoutes=true,CombinedServices=true
```

### Documentation

You can find feature preview documentation for alpha maturity features in the [kubernetes-ingress-controller repository](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/main/FEATURE_PREVIEW_DOCUMENTATION.md)..
