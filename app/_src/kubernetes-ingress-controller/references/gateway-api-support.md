The {{site.kic_product_name}} supports the following resources and features in the
[Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/). By default:

- Core features are supported. If a core feature is not supported in any
  of the released versions yet, it will be listed in `Unsupported` section.
- Extended features are not supported. If an extended feature is supported in 
  any of the released versions, it will be listed in the section of the 
  first version that support the feature.

## Gateways and GatewayClasses

### v2.2.x

- Supported `v1alpha2` version of Gateways and GatewayClasses.

### v2.5.x

- Added support for `TLSConfig` section to load certificates for HTTPRoutes and
  TLSRoutes attached to the Gateway.

### v2.6.x

- Supported `v1beta1` version of Gateways and GatewayClasses, and removed support of `v1alpha2` version of Gateways and GatewayClasses.

### Unsupported

- Kong [only supports a single Gateway per GatewayClass](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/{{page.kong_version}}/concepts/gateway-api#listener-compatibility-and-handling-multiple-gateways).

## HTTP Routes

### v2.2.x

- Supported `v1alpha2` version of HTTPRoute.
- Supported extended feature: supported `method` in route matches.

### v2.4.x

- Supported weights of `BackendRefs`. Multiple `BackendRefs` with a round-robin load-balancing strategy

  can allow you to fine-tune the load-balancing between those backend services.

### Unsupported
- Does not support `queryParam` in route matches.

- HTTPRoutes cannot be bound to a specific port using a [ParentReference](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/references/spec/#gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1beta1.ParentReference).
  Kong serves all HTTP routes on all HTTP listeners.
