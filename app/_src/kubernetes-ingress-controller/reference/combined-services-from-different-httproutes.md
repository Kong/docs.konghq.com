title: Combined Services From Different HTTPRoutes 
type: reference
purpose: |
  Introduce the feature gate to consolidate {{site.base_gateway}} services by combining rules from different HTTPRoutes
alpha: true
---

As have been done to `Ingress`es, {{site.kic_product_name}} can consolidate rules from different `HTTPRoute`s with the same
combination of backend services and translate them into one {{site.base_gateway}} service to reduce the number of {{site.base_gateway}} services.
The feature is enabled when the feature gate `CombinedServicesFromDifferentHTTPRoutes` is set to `true`.
When the feature is enabled, The rules with the same combination of backend services(combination of namespace, name, port and weight in `backendRefs` of rules)
in all `HTTPRoute`s within the same namespace will be translated to one {{site.base_gateway}} service.

## Changes on Translated {{site.base_gateway}} Service Names

The names of translated {{site.base_gateway}} service will be changed when the feature is enabled. Instead of generating names from source `HTTPRoute`
and rules, the {{site.base_gateway}} service names will be generated from the consolidated backends.

### Calculate Service Name

Names of {{site.base_gateway}} services will be calculated from the namespace, name, port and weight(if specified). The pattern of names is
`httproute.<namespace>.svc.<backend_ns>.<backend_name>.<backend_port>.[backend_weight]_[next_backends]...` where:
 - `namespace` is the namespace of the `HTTPRoute`s.
 - `backend_ns` is the namespace of the first backend service.
 - `backend_name` is the name of the first backend service.
 - `backend_port` is the port number of the first backend service.
 - `backend_weight` is the weight  of the first backend service if specified.
 - `next_backends` are sections calculated from other backend services. Backend services are sorted by the namespace and name.
For example, the following two `HTTPRoute`s with rules pointing to the same backends with the same ports and weights:

```yaml
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: httproute-consolidated-1
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: kong
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /httproute-testing
    backendRefs:
    - name: echo-1
      kind: Service
      port: 80
      weight: 75
    - name: echo-2
      kind: Service
      port: 8080
      weight: 25
---
apiVersion: gateway.networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: HTTPRoute
metadata:
  name: httproute-consolidated-2
  namespace: default
spec:
  parentRefs:
  - name: kong
  rules:
  - matches:
    - path:
        type: PathPrefix
        value: /httproute-testing
    backendRefs:
    - name: echo-1
      kind: Service
      port: 80
      weight: 75
    - name: echo-2
      kind: Service
      port: 8080
      weight: 25
```

The two rules from the two `HTTPRoute`s `httproute-consolidated-1` and `httproute-consolidated-2` will be translated to one {{site.base_gateway}} service
with name `httproute.default.svc.default.echo-1.80.75.default.echo-2.80.25`.

### Trimming {{site.base_gateway}} Service Names

Technically, the calculated name from the method in the section above can be too long. So when the calculate name is longer than 512 characters(the limit of service name length in {{site.konnect_short_name}}),
the service name is trimmed to make sure that the translated service name does not exceed 512 characters. The trimmed name will only preserve the information(namespace, name, port, weight) of the first backend service,
then we append the `_combined.<hash>` suffix to the name to make sure that the name is unique. `hash` is the SHA256 hash sum of the calculated service name.
