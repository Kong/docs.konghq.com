### KongClusterPlugin

KongClusterPlugin is the Schema for the kongclusterplugins API.

{% include md/kic/crd-ref/kong_cluster_plugin_description.md kong_version=page.kong_version %}

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` _string_ | `configuration.konghq.com/v1`
| `kind` _string_ | `KongClusterPlugin`
| `metadata` _[ObjectMeta](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.25/#objectmeta-v1-meta)_ | Refer to Kubernetes API documentation for fields of `metadata`. |
| `consumerRef` _string_ | ConsumerRef is a reference to a particular consumer. |
| `disabled` _boolean_ | Disabled set if the plugin is disabled or not. |
| `config` _[JSON](#json)_ | Config contains the plugin configuration. It's a list of keys and values required to configure the plugin. Please read the documentation of the plugin being configured to set values in here. For any plugin in Kong, anything that goes in the `config` JSON key in the Admin API request, goes into this property. Only one of `config` or `configFrom` may be used in a KongClusterPlugin, not both at once. |
| `configFrom` _[NamespacedConfigSource](#namespacedconfigsource)_ | ConfigFrom references a secret containing the plugin configuration. This should be used when the plugin configuration contains sensitive information, such as AWS credentials in the Lambda plugin or the client secret in the OIDC plugin. Only one of `config` or `configFrom` may be used in a KongClusterPlugin, not both at once. |
| `plugin` _string_ | PluginName is the name of the plugin to which to apply the config. |
| `run_on` _string_ | RunOn configures the plugin to run on the first or the second or both nodes in case of a service mesh deployment. |
| `protocols` _[KongProtocol](#kongprotocol) array_ | Protocols configures plugin to run on requests received on specific protocols. |
| `ordering` _PluginOrdering_ | Ordering overrides the normal plugin execution order. It's only available on Kong Enterprise. `<phase>` is a request processing phase (for example, `access` or `body_filter`) and `<plugin>` is the name of the plugin that will run before or after the KongPlugin. For example, a KongPlugin with `plugin: rate-limiting` and `before.access: ["key-auth"]` will create a rate limiting plugin that limits requests _before_ they are authenticated. |
| `instance_name` _string_ | InstanceName is an optional custom name to identify an instance of the plugin. This is useful when running the same plugin in multiple contexts, for example, on multiple services. |
