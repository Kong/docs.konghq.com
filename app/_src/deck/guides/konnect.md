title: Using decK with Kong Konnect
content_type: reference
---

You can manage {{site.base_gateway}} core entity configuration in your {{site.konnect_short_name}} organization using decK.

decK can only target one control plane at a time.

Managing multiple control planes requires a separate state file per control plane.

You _cannot_ use decK to publish content to the Dev Portal, manage application registration, or configure custom plugins.

## {{site.konnect_short_name}} flags

You can use decK commands such as `ping`, `diff`, or `sync` with `--konnect` flags to interact with {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

If you don't pass a {{site.konnect_short_name}} flag to decK, decK looks for a local {{site.base_gateway}} instance instead.

`--konnect-addr`
:  Address of the {{site.konnect_short_name}} endpoint. (Default: `"https://us.api.konghq.com"`)

{% if_version lte:1.26.x %}
`--konnect-runtime-group-name`
:  {{site.konnect_short_name}} runtime group name.
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version gte:1.27.x %}
`--konnect-control-plane-name`
:  {{site.konnect_short_name}} control plane name.
{% endif_version %}

`--konnect-token`
:  Personal access token associated with your {{site.konnect_short_name}} account (`kpat_*`), or with a system account (`spat_*`). This takes precedence over the `--konnect-token-file` flag.

`--konnect-token-file`
:  File containing the personal access token to your {{site.konnect_short_name}} account, or to a system account.

{:.note}
> **Note:** Prior to decK 1.12, decK provided [`deck konnect`](/deck/1.11.x/reference/deck_konnect/) commands.
Those commands are deprecated and have been replaced with the flags in this guide.

## Authenticate with {{site.konnect_short_name}}

decK looks for {{site.konnect_short_name}} credentials in the following order of precedence:

1. Credential set with the `--konnect-token` flag 
2. decK configuration file, if one exists (default lookup path: `$HOME/.deck.yaml`)
3. Credential file passed with the `--konnect-token-file` flag

For example, if you have both a decK config file and a {{site.konnect_short_name}} token file, decK uses the token in the config file.


{:.note}
> **Note:** decK also includes flags to authenticate to {{site.konnect_short_name}} via email and password. This is no longer supported by {{site.konnect_short_name}}; instead, use a token as described below.

### Authenticate using a decK config file

By default, decK looks for a configuration file named `.deck.yaml` in the `$HOME` directory.
This file lets you specify flags to include with every decK command.

You can create the file at the default location, or set a custom filename and path with [`--config`](/deck/{{page.release}}/reference/deck/).

If you store a {{site.konnect_short_name}} token in the file, decK uses the token for every command.

Set either `konnect-token` or `konnect-token-file` in the decK config file.

* Use `konnect-token` to store {{site.konnect_short_name}} credentials directly in the configuration file:

    ```
    konnect-token: YOUR_TOKEN
    ```

* Store your token in a separate file, then specify the path to `konnect-token-file` instead of a literal token:

    ```
    konnect-token-file: PATH/TO/FILENAME
    ```

decK automatically uses the token from `$HOME/.deck.yaml` in any subsequent calls:
{% if_version lte:1.27.x %}
```sh
deck ping

Successfully Konnected to the Example-Name organization!
```
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte:1.28.x %}
```sh
deck gateway ping

Successfully Konnected to the Example-Name organization!
```
{% endif_version %}

### Authenticate using a token

You can generate a token in {{site.konnect_short_name}} for authentication with decK commands. 

There are two types of tokens available for {{site.konnect_short_name}}: 
* Personal access tokens associated with user accounts (PATs)
* System account access tokens associated with system accounts (SPATs)

Learn more about system accounts in the [{{site.konnect_short_name}} System Accounts documentation](/konnect/org-management/system-accounts/).

Before you generate a token, keep the following in mind:

* A token is granted all of the permissions that the user or system account has access to via their most up-to-date role assignment.
* The token has a maximum duration of 12 months.
* There is a limit of 10 personal access tokens per user.
* Unused tokens are deleted and revoked after 12 months of inactivity.

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab User Account Token %}

To generate a PAT for a user account in {{site.konnect_short_name}}, select your user icon to open the context menu 
 and click **Personal access tokens**, then click **Generate token**. 

{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab System Account Token %}

[Create a system account token](/konnect/org-management/system-accounts/#generate-a-system-account-access-token) through the {{site.konnect_short_name}} API.

{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

{:.important}
> **Important**: The access token is only displayed once, so make sure you save it securely. 

You can use the `--konnect-token` flag to pass the PAT directly in the command:

{% if_version lte:1.27.x %}
```sh
deck ping \
  --konnect-token YOUR_KONNECT_TOKEN
```
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte:1.28.x %}
```sh
deck gateway ping \
  --konnect-token YOUR_KONNECT_TOKEN
```
{% endif_version %}

You can save your {{site.konnect_short_name}}
token to a file, then pass the filename to decK with `--konnect-token-file`:

{% if_version lte:1.27.x %}
```sh
deck ping \
  --konnect-token-file /PATH/TO/FILE
```
{% endif_version %}
{% if_version gte:1.28.x %}
```sh
deck gateway ping \
  --konnect-token-file /PATH/TO/FILE
```
{% endif_version %}

## Target a {{site.konnect_short_name}} API

Use `--konnect-addr` to select the API to connect to.

The default API decK uses is `https://us.api.konghq.com`, which targets the `cloud.konghq.com` environment.

{% if_version gte:1.14.x %}

{{site.base_gateway}} supports AU, EU, and US [geographic regions](/konnect/geo/).

To target a specific geo, set `konnect-addr` to one of the following:
* AU geo:`"https://au.api.konghq.com"`
* EU geo:`"https://eu.api.konghq.com"`
* US geo:`"https://us.api.konghq.com"`

{% endif_version %}

## Control planes

Each [state file](/deck/{{page.release}}/terminology/#state-files) targets one control plane.
If you don't provide a control plane, decK targets the `default` control plane.

If you have a custom control plane, you can specify it in the state file,
or use a flag when running any decK command.

{% if_version lte:1.26.x %}
* Target a control plane in your state file with the `_konnect.runtime_group_name` parameter:

    ```yaml
    _format_version: "3.0"
    _konnect:
      runtime_group_name: staging
    ```

* Set a control plane using the `--konnect-runtime-group-name` flag:

    ```sh
    deck sync --konnect-runtime-group-name staging
    ```
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version eq:1.27.x %}
* Target a control plane in your state file with the `_konnect.control_plane_name` parameter:

    ```yaml
    _format_version: "3.0"
    _konnect:
      control_plane_name: staging
    ```

* Set a control plane using the `--konnect-control-plane-name` flag:

    ```sh
    deck sync --konnect-control-plane-name staging
    ```
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version gte:1.28.x %}
* Target a control plane in your state file with the `_konnect.control_plane_name` parameter:

    ```yaml
    _format_version: "3.0"
    _konnect:
      control_plane_name: staging
    ```

* Set a control plane using the `--konnect-control-plane-name` flag:

    ```sh
    deck gateway sync konnect.yaml --konnect-control-plane-name staging
    ```
{% endif_version %}

## Troubleshoot

### Authentication with a {{site.konnect_short_name}} token file is not working

If you have verified that your token is correct but decK can't connect to your account, check for conflicts with the decK config file (`$HOME/.deck.yaml`) and the {{site.konnect_short_name}} token file.
A decK config file is likely conflicting with the token file and passing another set of credentials.

To resolve, remove one of the duplicate sets of credentials.

### Workspace connection refused

When migrating from {{site.base_gateway}} to {{site.konnect_short_name}}, make sure to remove any `_workspace` tags. If you leave `_workspace` in, you get the following error:

```
Error: checking if workspace exists
```

Remove the `_workspace` key to resolve this error.

You can now sync the file as-is to apply it to the default control plane or add a key to apply the configuration to a specific control plane.

{% if_version lte:1.26.x %}
To apply the configuration to custom control planes, replace `_workspace` with `control_plane_name: ExampleName`.
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version gte:1.27.x %}
To apply the configuration to custom control planes, replace `_workspace` with `control_plane_name: ExampleName`.
{% endif_version %}

For example, to export the configuration from workspace `staging` to control plane `staging`, you would change:

```yaml
_workspace: staging
```

To:
{% if_version lte:1.26.x %}
```yaml
_konnect:
  runtime_group_name: staging
```
{% endif_version %}

{% if_version gte:1.27.x %}
```yaml
_konnect:
  control_plane_name: staging
```
{% endif_version %}

### ACL, Key Auth, or OpenID Connect plugins and app registration

You may encounter one of the following scenarios with the ACL, Key Authentication, or OpenID Connect (OIDC) plugins:
* The plugins are visible in the Gateway Manager, but don't appear in the output from a decK `dump` or `diff`.
* When trying to set up one of the plugins with app registration enabled, you see the following error:

    ```
    {Create} plugin key-auth for service example_service failed: HTTP status 400
    ```

This is intentional. When you have application registration enabled, decK doesn't manage these plugins, and doesn't let you create duplicates of the plugin entries.

When setting up app registration, {{site.konnect_short_name}} enables two plugins automatically: ACL, and either Key Authentication or OIDC, depending on your choice of authentication.
These plugins run in the background to support application registration for an API product.
They are managed entirely by {{site.konnect_short_name}}, so you can't manage these plugins directly.

Read [Manage application registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg) for more information.

{% if_version gte:1.15 %}

### decK targets {{site.base_gateway}} instead of {{site.konnect_short_name}}

decK can run against {{site.base_gateway}} or {{site.konnect_short_name}}.
By default, it targets {{site.base_gateway}}, unless a setting tells decK to point to {{site.konnect_short_name}} instead.

decK determines the environment using the following order of precedence:

1. If the declarative configuration file contains the `_konnect` entry, decK runs
against {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

2. If the `--kong-addr` flag is set to a non-default value, decK runs against {{site.base_gateway}}.

3. If {{site.konnect_short_name}} token is set in any way (flag, file, or decK config), decK runs against {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

4. If none of the above are present, decK runs against {{site.base_gateway}}.
