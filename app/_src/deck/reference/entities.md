decK manages entity configuration for {{site.base_gateway}}, including all core proxy entities.

It does not manage {{site.base_gateway}} configuration parameters in `kong.conf`, or content and configuration for the Dev Portal.

> **\[1\]**: decK doesn't manage documents (`document_objects`) related to services, which means they are not included in dump/sync actions.
If you attempt to delete a service that has an associated document via decK, it will fail.
[Manage service documents directly](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/applications/managing-applications/#add-a-document-to-your-service) through Kong Manager.

> **\[2\]**: decK can create workspaces and manage entities in a given workspace. 
However, decK can't delete workspaces, and it can't update multiple workspaces simultaneously.
See [Manage multiple workspaces](/deck/{{page.kong_version}}/guides/kong-enterprise/#manage-multiple-workspaces) for more information.

While deck can manage a majority of {{site.base_gateway}}'s configuration, we recommend additional arrangements for deployment, backup, and restoring unmanaged entities for a more comprehensive approach.

In the event that the data plane loses connection to the control plane in hybrid mode, the data plane can continue to function using a [backup declarative configuration file](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#declarative_config). This feature is not available if you have any unmanaged entities configured.
