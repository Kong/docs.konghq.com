The validate command reads the state file and ensures validity.
It reads all the specified state files and reports YAML/JSON
parsing issues. It also checks for foreign relationships
and alerts if there are broken relationships, or missing links present.

No communication takes places between decK and Kong during the execution of
this command unless the `--online` flag is used.


## Syntax

```
deck file validate [command-specific flags] [global flags]
```

## Flags

`-h`, `--help`
:  Help for validate.

`--online`
:  Perform validations against the Kong API. When this flag is used, validation is done
via communication with Kong. This increases the time for validation but catches 
significant errors. No resource is created in Kong. (Default: `false`)

`--parallelism`
:  Maximum number of concurrent requests to Kong. (Default: `10`)

`--rbac-resources-only`
:  Indicate that the state file(s) contains RBAC resources only (Kong Enterprise only). (Default: `false`)

`-s`, `--state`
:  File(s) containing Kong's configuration.
This flag can be specified multiple times for multiple files.
Use `-` to read from stdin. (Default: `[kong.yaml]`)

`-w`, `--workspace`
:  Validate configuration of a specific workspace (Kong Enterprise only).
This takes precedence over `_workspace` fields in state files.



## Global flags

`--analytics`
:  Share anonymized data to help improve decK.
Use `--analytics=false` to disable this. (Default: `true`)

`--ca-cert`
:  Custom CA certificate (raw contents) to use to verify Kong's Admin TLS certificate.
This value can also be set using DECK_CA_CERT environment variable.
This takes precedence over `--ca-cert-file` flag.

`--ca-cert-file`
:  Path to a custom CA certificate to use to verify Kong's Admin TLS certificate.
This value can also be set using DECK_CA_CERT_FILE environment variable.

`--config`
:  Config file (default is $HOME/.deck.yaml).

`--headers`
:  HTTP headers (key:value) to inject in all requests to Kong's Admin API.
This flag can be specified multiple times to inject multiple headers.

`--kong-addr`
:  HTTP address of Kong's Admin API.
This value can also be set using the environment variable DECK_KONG_ADDR
 environment variable. (Default: `"http://localhost:8001"`)

`--kong-cookie-jar-path`
:  Absolute path to a cookie-jar file in the Netscape cookie format for auth with Admin Server.
You may also need to pass in as header the User-Agent that was used to create the cookie-jar.

`--konnect-addr`
:  Address of the Konnect endpoint. (Default: `"https://us.api.konghq.com"`)

`--konnect-email`
:  Email address associated with your Konnect account.

:  File containing the password to your Konnect account.

`--konnect-runtime-group-name`
:  Konnect Runtime group name.

`--konnect-token`
:  Personal Access Token associated with your Konnect account, this takes precedence over `--konnect-token-file` flag.

`--konnect-token-file`
:  File containing the Peronsal Access Token to your Konnect account.

`--no-color`
:  Disable colorized output (Default: `false`)

`--skip-workspace-crud`
:  Skip API calls related to Workspaces (Kong Enterprise only). (Default: `false`)

`--timeout`
:  Set a request timeout for the client to connect with Kong (in seconds). (Default: `10`)

`--tls-client-cert`
:  PEM-encoded TLS client certificate to use for authentication with Kong's Admin API.
This value can also be set using DECK_TLS_CLIENT_CERT environment variable. Must be used in conjunction with tls-client-key

`--tls-client-cert-file`
:  Path to the file containing TLS client certificate to use for authentication with Kong's Admin API.
This value can also be set using DECK_TLS_CLIENT_CERT_FILE environment variable. Must be used in conjunction with tls-client-key-file

`--tls-client-key`
:  PEM-encoded private key for the corresponding client certificate .
This value can also be set using DECK_TLS_CLIENT_KEY environment variable. Must be used in conjunction with tls-client-cert

`--tls-client-key-file`
:  Path to file containing the private key for the corresponding client certificate.
This value can also be set using DECK_TLS_CLIENT_KEY_FILE environment variable. Must be used in conjunction with tls-client-cert-file
