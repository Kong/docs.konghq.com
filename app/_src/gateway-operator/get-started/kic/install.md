Both {{ site.kgo_product_name }} and {{ site.kic_product_name }} can be configured using the [Kubernetes Gateway API](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api).

You can configure your `GatewayClass` and `Gateway` objects in a vendor independent way and {{ site.kgo_product_name }} translates those requirements in to Kong specific configuration.

This means that CRDs for both the Gateway API and {{ site.kic_product_name }} have to be installed.

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/gateway-api/releases/download/v1.0.0/standard-install.yaml
```
