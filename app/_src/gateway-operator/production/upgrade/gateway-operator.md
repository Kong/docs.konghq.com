title: Upgrading Gateway Operator
---

We're striving to adhere to [Semantic Versioning][semver] and to not include breaking
changes between major releases.

Major release might bring some breaking changes but they don't have.

In order to upgrade the operator:

1. Take a look at the [changelog](/gateway-operator/changelog) whether there are any changes that are documented to require manual action.

1. If there are any, then follow the steps listed in the changelog.

1. If there are none then just follow the steps mentioned in the [installation guide](/gateway-operator/{{ page.release }}/install/) using the version that you're upgrading to.
