### AIGateway


AIGateway is a network Gateway enabling access and management for AI &
Machine Learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM).<br /><br />
The underlying technology for the AIGateway is the Kong Gateway configured
with a variety of plugins which provide the the AI featureset.<br /><br />
This is a list of the plugins, which are available in Kong Gateway v3.6.x+:<br /><br />
  - ai-proxy (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-proxy)
  - ai-request-transformer (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-request-transformer)
  - ai-response-transformers (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-response-transformer)
  - ai-prompt-template (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-template)
  - ai-prompt-guard-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-guard)
  - ai-prompt-decorator-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-decorator)<br /><br />
So effectively the AIGateway resource provides a bespoke Gateway resource
(which it owns and manages) with the gateway, consumers and plugin
configurations automated and configurable via Kubernetes APIs.<br /><br />
The current iteration only supports the proxy itself, but the API is being
built with room for future growth in several dimensions. For instance:<br /><br />
  - Supporting auxiliary functions (e.g. decorator, guard, templater, token-rate-limit)
  - Supporting request/response transformers
  - Supporting more than just LLMs (e.g. CCNs, GANs, e.t.c.)
  - Supporting more hosting options for LLMs (e.g. self hosted)
  - Supporting more AI cloud providers
  - Supporting more AI cloud provider features<br /><br />
The validation rules throughout are set up to ensure at least one
cloud-provider-based LLM is specified, but in the future when we have more
model types and more hosting options for those types so we may want to look
into using CEL validation to ensure that at least one model configuration is
provided. We may also want to use CEL to validate things like identifier
unique-ness, e.t.c.<br /><br />

| `model` _string_ | Model is the model name of the LLM (e.g. gpt-3.5-turbo, phi-2, e.t.c.).<br /><br /> If not specified, whatever the cloud provider specifies as the default model will be used. |
| `promptType` _[LLMPromptType](#llmprompttype)_ | PromptType is the type of prompt to be used for inference requests to the LLM (e.g. "chat", "completions").<br /><br /> If "chat" is specified, prompts sent by the user will be interactive, contextual and stateful. The LLM will dynamically answer questions and simulate a dialogue, while also keeping track of the conversation to provide contextually relevant responses.<br /><br /> If "completions" is specified, prompts sent by the user will be stateless and "one-shot". The LLM will provide a single response to the prompt, without any context from previous prompts.<br /><br /> If not specified, "completions" will be used as the default. |
| `defaultPrompts` _[LLMPrompt](#llmprompt) array_ | DefaultPrompts is a list of prompts that should be provided to the LLM by default. This is generally used to influence inference behavior, for instance by providing a "system" role prompt that instructs the LLM to take on a certain persona. |
| `defaultPromptParams` _[LLMPromptParams](#llmpromptparams)_ | DefaultPromptParams configures the parameters which will be sent with any and every inference request.<br /><br /> If this is set, there is currently no way to override these parameters at the individual prompt level.

- [DataPlaneMetricsExtension](#dataplanemetricsextension)

#### EndpointNetworkAccessHint
_Underlying type:_ `string`

EndpointNetworkAccessHint provides a human readable indication of what kind
of network access is expected for a Gateway.<br /><br />

- [ControlPlaneOptions](#controlplaneoptions)
- [ControlPlaneSpec](#controlplanespec)

#### LLMPrompt


LLMPrompt is a text prompt that includes parameters, a role and content.<br /><br />
This is intended for situations like when you need to provide roles in a
prompt to an LLM in order to influence its behavior and responses.<br /><br />
For example, you might want to provide a "system" role and tell the LLM
something like "you are a helpful assistant who responds in the style of
Sherlock Holmes".



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `content` _string_ | Content is the prompt text sent for inference. |
| `role` _[LLMPromptRole](#llmpromptrole)_ | Role indicates the role of the prompt. This is used to identify the prompt's purpose, such as "system" or "user" and can influence the behavior of the LLM.<br /><br /> If not specified, "user" will be used as the default. |


_Appears in:_
- [CloudHostedLargeLanguageModel](#cloudhostedlargelanguagemodel)

#### LLMPromptParams


LLMPromptParams contains parameters that can be used to control the behavior
of a large language model (LLM) when generating text based on a prompt.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `temperature` _string_ | Temperature controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 to 0.7) makes the model more confident in its predictions, leading to more repetitive and deterministic outputs. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8 to 1.0) increases randomness, generating more diverse and creative outputs. At very high temperatures, the outputs may become nonsensical or highly unpredictable. |
| `maxTokens` _integer_ | Max Tokens specifies the maximum length of the model's output in terms of the number of tokens (words or pieces of words). This parameter limits the output's size, ensuring the model generates content within a manageable scope. A token can be a word or part of a word, depending on the model's tokenizer. |
| `topK` _integer_ | TopK sampling is a technique where the model's prediction is limited to the K most likely next tokens at each step of the generation process. The probability distribution is truncated to these top K tokens, and the next token is randomly sampled from this subset. This method helps in reducing the chance of selecting highly improbable tokens, making the text more coherent. A smaller K leads to more predictable text, while a larger K allows for more diversity but with an increased risk of incoherence. |
| `topP` _string_ | TopP (also known as nucleus sampling) is an alternative to top K sampling. Instead of selecting the top K tokens, top P sampling chooses from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold P. This method dynamically adjusts the number of tokens considered at each step, depending on their probability distribution. It helps in maintaining diversity while also avoiding very unlikely tokens. A higher P value increases diversity but can lead to less coherence, whereas a lower P value makes the model's outputs more focused and coherent. |
