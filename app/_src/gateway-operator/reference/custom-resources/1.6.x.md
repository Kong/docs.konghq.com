{% include md/k8s/crd-ref/kong_cluster_plugin_description.md kong_version=page.kong_version %}

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `apiVersion` _string_ | `configuration.konghq.com/v1`
| `kind` _string_ | `KongClusterPlugin`
| `metadata` _[ObjectMeta](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#objectmeta-v1-meta)_ | Refer to Kubernetes API documentation for fields of `metadata`. |
| `consumerRef` _string_ | ConsumerRef is a reference to a particular consumer. |
| `disabled` _boolean_ | Disabled set if the plugin is disabled or not. |
| `config` _[JSON](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#json-v1-apiextensions-k8s-io)_ | Config contains the plugin configuration. It's a list of keys and values required to configure the plugin. Please read the documentation of the plugin being configured to set values in here. For any plugin in Kong, anything that goes in the `config` JSON key in the Admin API request, goes into this property. Only one of `config` or `configFrom` may be used in a KongClusterPlugin, not both at once. |
| `configFrom` _[NamespacedConfigSource](#namespacedconfigsource)_ | ConfigFrom references a secret containing the plugin configuration. This should be used when the plugin configuration contains sensitive information, such as AWS credentials in the Lambda plugin or the client secret in the OIDC plugin. Only one of `config` or `configFrom` may be used in a KongClusterPlugin, not both at once. |
| `configPatches` _[NamespacedConfigPatch](#namespacedconfigpatch) array_ | ConfigPatches represents JSON patches to the configuration of the plugin. Each item means a JSON patch to add something in the configuration, where path is specified in `path` and value is in `valueFrom` referencing a key in a secret. When Config is specified, patches will be applied to the configuration in Config. Otherwise, patches will be applied to an empty object. |
| `plugin` _string_ | PluginName is the name of the plugin to which to apply the config. |
| `run_on` _string_ | RunOn configures the plugin to run on the first or the second or both nodes in case of a service mesh deployment. |
| `protocols` _[KongProtocol](#kongprotocol) array_ | Protocols configures plugin to run on requests received on specific protocols. |
| `ordering` _[PluginOrdering](#pluginordering)_ | Ordering overrides the normal plugin execution order. It's only available on Kong Enterprise. `<phase>` is a request processing phase (for example, `access` or `body_filter`) and `<plugin>` is the name of the plugin that will run before or after the KongPlugin. For example, a KongPlugin with `plugin: rate-limiting` and `before.access: ["key-auth"]` will create a rate limiting plugin that limits requests _before_ they are authenticated. |
| `instance_name` _string_ | InstanceName is an optional custom name to identify an instance of the plugin. This is useful when running the same plugin in multiple contexts, for example, on multiple services. |

| `headers` _object (keys:string, values:string array)_ | One or more lists of values indexed by header name that will cause this Route to match if present in the request. The `Host` header cannot be used with this attribute: hosts should be specified using the `hosts` attribute. When `headers` contains only one value and that value starts with the special prefix `~*`, the value is interpreted as a regular expression. |
| `hosts` _string array_ | A list of domain names that match this Route. Note that the hosts value is case sensitive. |
| `https_redirect_status_code` _[HTTPSRedirectStatusCode](#httpsredirectstatuscode)_ | The status code Kong responds with when all properties of a Route match except the protocol i.e. if the protocol of the request is `HTTP` instead of `HTTPS`. `Location` header is injected by Kong if the field is set to 301, 302, 307 or 308. Note: This config applies only if the Route is configured to only accept the `https` protocol. |
| `methods` _string array_ | A list of HTTP methods that match this Route. |

| `preserve_host` _boolean_ | When matching a Route via one of the `hosts` domain names, use the request `Host` header in the upstream request headers. If set to `false`, the upstream `Host` header will be that of the Service's `host`. |
| `protocols` _RouteJSONProtocols array_ | An array of the protocols this Route should allow. See KongRoute for a list of accepted protocols. When set to only `"https"`, HTTP requests are answered with an upgrade error. When set to only `"http"`, HTTPS requests are answered with an error. |
| `regex_priority` _integer_ | A number used to choose which route resolves a given request when several routes match it using regexes simultaneously. When two routes match the path and have the same `regex_priority`, the older one (lowest `created_at`) is used. Note that the priority for non-regex routes is different (longer non-regex routes are matched before shorter ones). |
| `request_buffering` _boolean_ | Whether to enable request body buffering or not. With HTTP 1.1, it may make sense to turn this off on services that receive data with chunked transfer encoding. |
| `response_buffering` _boolean_ | Whether to enable response body buffering or not. With HTTP 1.1, it may make sense to turn this off on services that send data with chunked transfer encoding. |

### KongUpstreamPolicy


KongUpstreamPolicy allows configuring algorithm that should be used for load balancing traffic between Kong
Upstream's Targets. It also allows configuring health checks for Kong Upstream's Targets.<br /><br />
Its configuration is similar to Kong Upstream object (https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/admin-api/#upstream-object),
and it is applied to Kong Upstream objects created by the controller.<br /><br />
It can be attached to Services. To attach it to a Service, it has to be annotated with
`konghq.com/upstream-policy: <name>`, where `<name>` is the name of the KongUpstreamPolicy
object in the same namespace as the Service.<br /><br />
When attached to a Service, it will affect all Kong Upstreams created for the Service.<br /><br />
When attached to a Service used in a Gateway API *Route rule with multiple BackendRefs, all of its Services MUST
be configured with the same KongUpstreamPolicy. Otherwise, the controller will *ignore* the KongUpstreamPolicy.<br /><br />
Note: KongUpstreamPolicy doesn't implement Gateway API's GEP-713 strictly.
In particular, it doesn't use the TargetRef for attaching to Services and Gateway API *Routes - annotations are
used instead. This is to allow reusing the same KongUpstreamPolicy for multiple Services and Gateway API *Routes.

### AIGateway


AIGateway is a network Gateway enabling access and management for AI &
Machine Learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM).<br /><br />
The underlying technology for the AIGateway is the Kong Gateway configured
with a variety of plugins which provide the the AI featureset.<br /><br />
This is a list of the plugins, which are available in Kong Gateway v3.6.x+:<br /><br />
  - ai-proxy (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-proxy)
  - ai-request-transformer (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-request-transformer)
  - ai-response-transformers (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-response-transformer)
  - ai-prompt-template (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-template)
  - ai-prompt-guard-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-guard)
  - ai-prompt-decorator-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-decorator)<br /><br />
So effectively the AIGateway resource provides a bespoke Gateway resource
(which it owns and manages) with the gateway, consumers and plugin
configurations automated and configurable via Kubernetes APIs.<br /><br />
The current iteration only supports the proxy itself, but the API is being
built with room for future growth in several dimensions. For instance:<br /><br />
  - Supporting auxiliary functions (e.g. decorator, guard, templater, token-rate-limit)
  - Supporting request/response transformers
  - Supporting more than just LLMs (e.g. CCNs, GANs, e.t.c.)
  - Supporting more hosting options for LLMs (e.g. self hosted)
  - Supporting more AI cloud providers
  - Supporting more AI cloud provider features<br /><br />
The validation rules throughout are set up to ensure at least one
cloud-provider-based LLM is specified, but in the future when we have more
model types and more hosting options for those types so we may want to look
into using CEL validation to ensure that at least one model configuration is
provided. We may also want to use CEL to validate things like identifier
unique-ness, e.t.c.<br /><br />

- [CloudHostedLargeLanguageModel](#cloudhostedlargelanguagemodel)

#### LLMPromptParams


LLMPromptParams contains parameters that can be used to control the behavior
of a large language model (LLM) when generating text based on a prompt.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `temperature` _string_ | Temperature controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 to 0.7) makes the model more confident in its predictions, leading to more repetitive and deterministic outputs. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8 to 1.0) increases randomness, generating more diverse and creative outputs. At very high temperatures, the outputs may become nonsensical or highly unpredictable. |
| `maxTokens` _integer_ | Max Tokens specifies the maximum length of the model's output in terms of the number of tokens (words or pieces of words). This parameter limits the output's size, ensuring the model generates content within a manageable scope. A token can be a word or part of a word, depending on the model's tokenizer. |
| `topK` _integer_ | TopK sampling is a technique where the model's prediction is limited to the K most likely next tokens at each step of the generation process. The probability distribution is truncated to these top K tokens, and the next token is randomly sampled from this subset. This method helps in reducing the chance of selecting highly improbable tokens, making the text more coherent. A smaller K leads to more predictable text, while a larger K allows for more diversity but with an increased risk of incoherence. |
| `topP` _string_ | TopP (also known as nucleus sampling) is an alternative to top K sampling. Instead of selecting the top K tokens, top P sampling chooses from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold P. This method dynamically adjusts the number of tokens considered at each step, depending on their probability distribution. It helps in maintaining diversity while also avoiding very unlikely tokens. A higher P value increases diversity but can lead to less coherence, whereas a lower P value makes the model's outputs more focused and coherent. |

| `type` _[ServiceType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#servicetype-v1-core)_ | Type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br /> Valid options are `LoadBalancer` and `ClusterIP`.<br /><br /> `ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br /> `NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.<br /><br /> `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |

| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

When considering the endpoints for a Service, this must match the 'name' field in the EndpointPort. Optional if only one ServicePort is defined on this service. |
| `port` _integer_ | The port that will be exposed by this service. |
| `targetPort` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service. Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used (an identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should be omitted or set equal to the 'port' field. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#defining-a-service |
| `nodePort` _integer_ | The port on each node on which this service is exposed when type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. Usually assigned by the system. If a value is specified, in-range, and not in use it will be used, otherwise the operation will fail. If not specified, a port will be allocated if this Service requires one. If this field is specified when creating a Service which does not need it, creation will fail. This field will be wiped when updating a Service to no longer need it (e.g. changing type from NodePort to ClusterIP).<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#type-nodeport<br /><br /> Can only be specified if type is NodePort or LoadBalancer. |

| `minAvailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at least "minAvailable" pods selected by "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying "100%". |
| `maxUnavailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable". |
| `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` _[UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicyType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#unhealthypodevictionpolicytype-v1-policy)_ | UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".<br /><br /> Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used, which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.<br /><br /> IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br /> AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br /> Additional policies may be added in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.<br /><br /> This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field when the feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default). |

Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br /> Valid options are `LoadBalancer` and `ClusterIP`.<br /><br /> `ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br /> `NodePort` exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (the NodePort). To make the node port available, Kubernetes sets up a cluster IP address, the same as if you had requested a Service of type: ClusterIP.<br /><br /> `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |
| `name` _string_ | Name defines the name of the service. If Name is empty, the controller will generate a service name from the owning object. |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br /><br /> More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations |
| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

- [KongServiceFacade](#kongservicefacade)
### KongServiceFacade


KongServiceFacade allows creating separate Kong Services for a single Kubernetes
Service. It can be used as Kubernetes Ingress' backend (via its path's `backend.resource`
field). It's designed to enable creating two "virtual" Services in Kong that will point
to the same Kubernetes Service, but will have different configuration (e.g. different
set of plugins, different load balancing algorithm, etc.).<br /><br />
KongServiceFacade requires `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` annotation with a value
matching the ingressClass of the Kong Ingress Controller (`kong` by default) to be reconciled.
