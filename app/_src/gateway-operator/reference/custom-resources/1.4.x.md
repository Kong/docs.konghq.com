| `config` _[JSON](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#json-v1-apiextensions-k8s-io)_ | Config contains the plugin configuration. It's a list of keys and values required to configure the plugin. Please read the documentation of the plugin being configured to set values in here. For any plugin in Kong, anything that goes in the `config` JSON key in the Admin API request, goes into this property. Only one of `config` or `configFrom` may be used in a KongPlugin, not both at once. |
| `plugin` _string_ | PluginName is the name of the plugin to which to apply the config. |
| `run_on` _string_ | RunOn configures the plugin to run on the first or the second or both nodes in case of a service mesh deployment. |

| --- | --- |
| `destinations` _Destinations array_ | A list of IP destinations of incoming connections that match this Route when using stream routing. Each entry is an object with fields "ip" (optionally in CIDR range notation) and/or "port". |
| `headers` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | One or more lists of values indexed by header name that will cause this Route to match if present in the request. The `Host` header cannot be used with this attribute: hosts should be specified using the `hosts` attribute. When `headers` contains only one value and that value starts with the special prefix `~*`, the value is interpreted as a regular expression. |
| `hosts` _string array_ | A list of domain names that match this Route. Note that the hosts value is case sensitive. |
| `https_redirect_status_code` _[HTTPSRedirectStatusCode](#httpsredirectstatuscode)_ | The status code Kong responds with when all properties of a Route match except the protocol i.e. if the protocol of the request is `HTTP` instead of `HTTPS`. `Location` header is injected by Kong if the field is set to 301, 302, 307 or 308. Note: This config applies only if the Route is configured to only accept the `https` protocol. |
| `methods` _string array_ | A list of HTTP methods that match this Route. |
| `name` _string_ | The name of the Route. Route names must be unique, and they are case sensitive. For example, there can be two different Routes named "test" and "Test". |

| `paths` _string array_ | A list of paths that match this Route. |
| `preserve_host` _boolean_ | When matching a Route via one of the `hosts` domain names, use the request `Host` header in the upstream request headers. If set to `false`, the upstream `Host` header will be that of the Service's `host`. |
| `protocols` _RouteProtocols array_ | An array of the protocols this Route should allow. See KongRoute for a list of accepted protocols. When set to only `"https"`, HTTP requests are answered with an upgrade error. When set to only `"http"`, HTTPS requests are answered with an error. |
| `regex_priority` _integer_ | A number used to choose which route resolves a given request when several routes match it using regexes simultaneously. When two routes match the path and have the same `regex_priority`, the older one (lowest `created_at`) is used. Note that the priority for non-regex routes is different (longer non-regex routes are matched before shorter ones). |
| `request_buffering` _boolean_ | Whether to enable request body buffering or not. With HTTP 1.1, it may make sense to turn this off on services that receive data with chunked transfer encoding. |
| `response_buffering` _boolean_ | Whether to enable response body buffering or not. With HTTP 1.1, it may make sense to turn this off on services that send data with chunked transfer encoding. |

### AIGateway


AIGateway is a network Gateway enabling access and management for AI &
Machine Learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM).<br /><br />
The underlying technology for the AIGateway is the Kong Gateway configured
with a variety of plugins which provide the the AI featureset.<br /><br />
This is a list of the plugins, which are available in Kong Gateway v3.6.x+:<br /><br />
  - ai-proxy (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-proxy)
  - ai-request-transformer (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-request-transformer)
  - ai-response-transformers (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-response-transformer)
  - ai-prompt-template (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-template)
  - ai-prompt-guard-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-guard)
  - ai-prompt-decorator-plugin (https://github.com/kong/kong/tree/master/kong/plugins/ai-prompt-decorator)<br /><br />
So effectively the AIGateway resource provides a bespoke Gateway resource
(which it owns and manages) with the gateway, consumers and plugin
configurations automated and configurable via Kubernetes APIs.<br /><br />
The current iteration only supports the proxy itself, but the API is being
built with room for future growth in several dimensions. For instance:<br /><br />
  - Supporting auxiliary functions (e.g. decorator, guard, templater, token-rate-limit)
  - Supporting request/response transformers
  - Supporting more than just LLMs (e.g. CCNs, GANs, e.t.c.)
  - Supporting more hosting options for LLMs (e.g. self hosted)
  - Supporting more AI cloud providers
  - Supporting more AI cloud provider features<br /><br />
The validation rules throughout are set up to ensure at least one
cloud-provider-based LLM is specified, but in the future when we have more
model types and more hosting options for those types so we may want to look
into using CEL validation to ensure that at least one model configuration is
provided. We may also want to use CEL to validate things like identifier
unique-ness, e.t.c.<br /><br />

A secret configured this way MAY include any number of key-value pairs equal to the number of providers you have, but used this way the keys MUST be named according to their providers (e.g. "openai", "azure", "cohere", e.t.c.). For example:<br /><br />   apiVersion: v1   kind: Secret   metadata:     name: devteam-ai-cloud-providers   type: Opaque   data:     openai: *****************     azure: *****************     cohere: *****************<br /><br /> See AICloudProviderName for a list of known and valid cloud providers.<br /><br /> Note that the keys are NOT case-sensitive (e.g. "OpenAI", "openai", and "openAI" are all valid and considered the same keys) but if there are duplicates endpoints failures conditions will be emitted and endpoints will not be configured until the duplicates are resolved.<br /><br /> This is currently considered required, but in future iterations will be optional as we do things like enable configuring credentials at the model level. |

#### LLMPromptParams


LLMPromptParams contains parameters that can be used to control the behavior
of a large language model (LLM) when generating text based on a prompt.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `temperature` _string_ | Temperature controls the randomness of predictions by scaling the logits before applying softmax. A lower temperature (e.g., 0.0 to 0.7) makes the model more confident in its predictions, leading to more repetitive and deterministic outputs. A higher temperature (e.g., 0.8 to 1.0) increases randomness, generating more diverse and creative outputs. At very high temperatures, the outputs may become nonsensical or highly unpredictable. |
| `maxTokens` _integer_ | Max Tokens specifies the maximum length of the model's output in terms of the number of tokens (words or pieces of words). This parameter limits the output's size, ensuring the model generates content within a manageable scope. A token can be a word or part of a word, depending on the model's tokenizer. |
| `topK` _integer_ | TopK sampling is a technique where the model's prediction is limited to the K most likely next tokens at each step of the generation process. The probability distribution is truncated to these top K tokens, and the next token is randomly sampled from this subset. This method helps in reducing the chance of selecting highly improbable tokens, making the text more coherent. A smaller K leads to more predictable text, while a larger K allows for more diversity but with an increased risk of incoherence. |
| `topP` _string_ | TopP (also known as nucleus sampling) is an alternative to top K sampling. Instead of selecting the top K tokens, top P sampling chooses from the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds the threshold P. This method dynamically adjusts the number of tokens considered at each step, depending on their probability distribution. It helps in maintaining diversity while also avoiding very unlikely tokens. A higher P value increases diversity but can lead to less coherence, whereas a lower P value makes the model's outputs more focused and coherent. |

The ports field allows defining the name, port and targetPort of the underlying service ports, while the protocol is defaulted to TCP, as it is the only protocol currently supported. |
| `type` _[ServiceType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#servicetype-v1-core)_ | Type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br /> Valid options are `LoadBalancer` and `ClusterIP`.<br /><br /> `ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br /> `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata.

| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

| `port` _integer_ | The port that will be exposed by this service. |
| `targetPort` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | Number or name of the port to access on the pods targeted by the service. Number must be in the range 1 to 65535. Name must be an IANA_SVC_NAME. If this is a string, it will be looked up as a named port in the target Pod's container ports. If this is not specified, the value of the 'port' field is used (an identity map). This field is ignored for services with clusterIP=None, and should be omitted or set equal to the 'port' field.

| `type` _[ServiceType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#servicetype-v1-core)_ | Type determines how the Service is exposed. Defaults to `LoadBalancer`.<br /><br /> Valid options are `LoadBalancer` and `ClusterIP`.<br /><br /> `ClusterIP` allocates a cluster-internal IP address for load-balancing to endpoints.<br /><br /> `LoadBalancer` builds on NodePort and creates an external load-balancer (if supported in the current cloud) which routes to the same endpoints as the clusterIP.<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types |
| `annotations` _object (keys:string, values:string)_ | Annotations is an unstructured key value map stored with a resource that may be set by external tools to store and retrieve arbitrary metadata. They are not queryable and should be preserved when modifying objects.<br /><br /> More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/annotations |
| `externalTrafficPolicy` _[ServiceExternalTrafficPolicy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#serviceexternaltrafficpolicy-v1-core)_ | ExternalTrafficPolicy describes how nodes distribute service traffic they receive on one of the Service's "externally-facing" addresses (NodePorts, ExternalIPs, and LoadBalancer IPs). If set to "Local", the proxy will configure the service in a way that assumes that external load balancers will take care of balancing the service traffic between nodes, and so each node will deliver traffic only to the node-local endpoints of the service, without masquerading the client source IP. (Traffic mistakenly sent to a node with no endpoints will be dropped.) The default value, "Cluster", uses the standard behavior of routing to all endpoints evenly (possibly modified by topology and other features). Note that traffic sent to an External IP or LoadBalancer IP from within the cluster will always get "Cluster" semantics, but clients sending to a NodePort from within the cluster may need to take traffic policy into account when picking a node.<br /><br /> More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/create-external-load-balancer/#preserving-the-client-source-ip |

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minReplicas` _integer_ | minReplicas is the lower limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale down.  It defaults to 1 pod.  minReplicas is allowed to be 0 if the alpha feature gate HPAScaleToZero is enabled and at least one Object or External metric is configured.  Scaling is active as long as at least one metric value is available. |
| `maxReplicas` _integer_ | maxReplicas is the upper limit for the number of replicas to which the autoscaler can scale up. It cannot be less that minReplicas. |
| `metrics` _[MetricSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#metricspec-v2-autoscaling) array_ | metrics contains the specifications for which to use to calculate the desired replica count (the maximum replica count across all metrics will be used).  The desired replica count is calculated multiplying the ratio between the target value and the current value by the current number of pods.  Ergo, metrics used must decrease as the pod count is increased, and vice-versa.  See the individual metric source types for more information about how each type of metric must respond. If not set, the default metric will be set to 80% average CPU utilization. |
| `behavior` _[HorizontalPodAutoscalerBehavior](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#horizontalpodautoscalerbehavior-v2-autoscaling)_ | behavior configures the scaling behavior of the target in both Up and Down directions (scaleUp and scaleDown fields respectively). If not set, the default HPAScalingRules for scale up and scale down are used. |

_Appears in:_
- [DataPlaneResources](#dataplaneresources)

#### PodDisruptionBudgetSpec


PodDisruptionBudgetSpec defines the specification of a PodDisruptionBudget.



| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `minAvailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at least "minAvailable" pods selected by "selector" will still be available after the eviction, i.e. even in the absence of the evicted pod.  So for example you can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying "100%". |
| `maxUnavailable` _[IntOrString](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#intorstring-intstr-util)_ | An eviction is allowed if at most "maxUnavailable" pods selected by "selector" are unavailable after the eviction, i.e. even in absence of the evicted pod. For example, one can prevent all voluntary evictions by specifying 0. This is a mutually exclusive setting with "minAvailable". |
| `unhealthyPodEvictionPolicy` _[UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicyType](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/generated/kubernetes-api/v1.28/#unhealthypodevictionpolicytype-v1-policy)_ | UnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy defines the criteria for when unhealthy pods should be considered for eviction. Current implementation considers healthy pods, as pods that have status.conditions item with type="Ready",status="True".<br /><br /> Valid policies are IfHealthyBudget and AlwaysAllow. If no policy is specified, the default behavior will be used, which corresponds to the IfHealthyBudget policy.<br /><br /> IfHealthyBudget policy means that running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy can be evicted only if the guarded application is not disrupted (status.currentHealthy is at least equal to status.desiredHealthy). Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br /> AlwaysAllow policy means that all running pods (status.phase="Running"), but not yet healthy are considered disrupted and can be evicted regardless of whether the criteria in a PDB is met. This means perspective running pods of a disrupted application might not get a chance to become healthy. Healthy pods will be subject to the PDB for eviction.<br /><br /> Additional policies may be added in the future. Clients making eviction decisions should disallow eviction of unhealthy pods if they encounter an unrecognized policy in this field.<br /><br /> This field is beta-level. The eviction API uses this field when the feature gate PDBUnhealthyPodEvictionPolicy is enabled (enabled by default). |
