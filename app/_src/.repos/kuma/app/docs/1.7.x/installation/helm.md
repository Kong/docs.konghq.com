To install and run Kuma on Kubernetes with Helm charts execute the following steps:

* [1. Add the Kuma charts repository](#add-the-kuma-charts-repository)
* [2. Run Kuma](#run-kuma)
* [3. Use Kuma](#use-kuma)

Finally you can follow the [Quickstart](#quickstart) to take it from here and continue your Kuma journey.

Please note that at least version 3.8.0 of Helm is required to use the Kuma Helm charts. If you are using an older version of Helm, please upgrade to version 3.8.0 first.

{% tip %}
Kuma also provides an alternative [Kubernetes distribution](/docs/{{ page.version }}/installation/kubernetes/) that we can use instead of Helm charts.
{% endtip %}

### Add the Kuma charts repository

To start using Kuma with Helm charts, we first need to add the [Kuma charts repository](https://kumahq.github.io/charts) to our local Helm deployment: 

```sh
helm repo add kuma https://kumahq.github.io/charts
```

Once the repo is added, all following updates can be fetched with `helm repo update`.

### Run Kuma

At this point we can install and run Kuma using the following commands. We could use any Kubernetes namespace to install Kuma, by default we suggest using `kuma-system`:

```sh
helm install --create-namespace --namespace kuma-system kuma kuma/kuma
```

This example will run Kuma in `standalone` mode for a "flat" deployment, but there are more advanced [deployment modes](/docs/{{ page.version }}/introduction/deployments) like "multi-zone".

### Use Kuma

### Quickstart

Congratulations! You have successfully installed Kuma on Kubernetes ðŸš€. 

In order to start using Kuma, it's time to check out the [quickstart guide for Kubernetes](/docs/{{ page.version }}/quickstart/kubernetes/) deployments.

## Argo CD

Kuma requires a certificate to verify a connection between the control plane and a data plane proxy.
Kuma Helm chart autogenerate self-signed certificate if the certificate isn't explicitly set.
Argo CD uses `helm template` to compare and apply Kubernetes YAMLs.
Helm template doesn't work with chart logic to verify if the certificate is present.
This results in replacing the certificate on each Argo redeployment.
The solution to this problem is to explicitly set the certificates.
See ["Data plane proxy to control plane communication"](/docs/{{ page.version }}/security/certificates#data-plane-proxy-to-control-plane-communication) to learn how to preconfigure Kuma with certificates.
