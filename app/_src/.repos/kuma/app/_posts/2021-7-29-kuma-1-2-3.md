We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma! Kuma 1.2.3 ships with fast-follow fixes and improvements to the previous version. We strongly suggest to upgrade, in order to take advantage of the latest and greatest when it comes to service mesh.

## Features

* :rocket: kumactl now always warns when the client and server versions cannot be confirmed to match.
* The data plane proxy type is now checked for a valid value (one of `ingress` or `dataplane`).
* Improvements to the control plane.

And more! The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
