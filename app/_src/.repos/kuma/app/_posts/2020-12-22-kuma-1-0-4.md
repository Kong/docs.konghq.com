For a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/0ec42aa981139b1552e695b17e0f474cd0d5bde9/CHANGELOG.md).

## Transparent Proxying

In this new release we are finally bringing transparent proxying support to universal mode for VMs and Bare Metal, in addition to the pre-existing support in Kubernetes. This is done by supporting a one-click installation of iptables rules on the machine where `kuma-dp` will be running. With transparent proxying in universal mode we can finally avoid describing explicit ‚Äúoutbound‚Äù entries in our data plane proxy specifications.

```sh
kumactl install transparent-proxy \
    --kuma-dp-user <kuma-dp user> \
    --kuma-cp-ip <kuma-cp ip>
```

To learn more about this new feature, you can read the [official documentation](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-website/blob/docs/release-1.0.x/docs/docs/1.0.4/documentation/transparent-proxying.md).
