_With 1.0.6 the Kuma GUI introduced the first few chart visualizations, more to come!_

## Notable Improvements in 1.0.6

- üöÄ Deep status checks on data planes proxies, their services and Kuma's services!
- üöÄ Five new load balancers in addition to round robin: least request, ring hash, consistent hash, random & maglev!
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecating Envoy xDS V2. Introduced support for Envoy xDS V3.**
- Fixed a bug affecting the outbound reconciler in Universal mode.
- Performance improvements in Universal mode when storing data in Postgres.
- And more!

For a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/0ec42aa981139b1552e695b17e0f474cd0d5bde9/CHANGELOG.md).

## Deep Status Checks

One of the most challenging things with service mesh is understanding - when things go wrong - exactly where they go wrong! With this new release we are introducing deep status checks that allow us to identify where problems occur on the data plane: our services or the Envoy data plane proxies. We have updated both the GUI and the CLI in order to retrieve this information:

We have also updated the services status checks, which can now have three different statuses: Online, Offline, Partially Degraded.

Of course the "kumactl" CLI can also be used to retrieve this information, like:

```sh
kumactl inspect services
# SERVICE                        STATUS               DATAPLANES
# demo-app_kuma-demo_svc_5000    Partially Degraded   2/2
# redis_kuma-demo_svc_6379       Online               1/1
```

## New Load Balancers

This new release also ships with new load balancers for our `TrafficRoute` policies, allowing us to now choose between five load balancers for our traffic:

- Round Robin
- Least Request
- Consistent Hashing
- Random
- Maglev

Since this feature is available in `TrafficRoute`, that also means we can have **different load balancing rules for different traffic paths**. For example communication from a `client` service to a `redis` service can be `roundRobin`, but communication to `backend` can be `leastRequest`, like:

```yaml
type: TrafficRoute
name: route-example
mesh: default
sources:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: client
destinations:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: redis
conf:
  loadBalancer:
    roundRobin: {}
  split:
    - weight: 100
      destination:
        kuma.io/service: redis
--
type: TrafficRoute
name: route-example
mesh: default
sources:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: client
destinations:
  - match:
      kuma.io/service: backend
conf:
  loadBalancer:
    leastRequest: {}
      choiceCount: 8
  split:
    - weight: 100
      destination:
        kuma.io/service: backend
```
