We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma that ships with an important installation change, as well as improvements to the product.

## Features

- ⚠️ All installation scripts are updated to a new location, because Bintray is shutting down. If you've written automation scripts that refer to the Bintray location, you need to update your scripts to point to the new location.
- Transparent proxying is improved.
- The GUI is improved.
- The locality is now always set in a multi-zone deployment.

For a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
