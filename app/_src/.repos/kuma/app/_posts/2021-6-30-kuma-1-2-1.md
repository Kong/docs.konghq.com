We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma! Kuma 1.2.1 ships with fast-follow fixes and improvements to the previous version. We strongly suggest to upgrade, in order to take advantage of the latest and greatest when it comes to service mesh.

## Features

* ðŸš€ The data plane proxy now provides an advertised address to the control plane for communication in cases where the address is not directly reachable.
* ðŸš€ SNI header now added when TLS is enabled, to permit communication with external services that require it.

Plus important bug fixes and memory footprint improvements. The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
