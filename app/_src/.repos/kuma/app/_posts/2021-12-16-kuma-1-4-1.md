We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma! Kuma 1.4.1 ships with new features, more performance improvements, and bug fixes. We strongly suggest to upgrade, in order to take advantage of the latest and greatest when it comes to service mesh.

## Features

* ðŸš€ Performance continues to be significantly improved. Weâ€™ve streamlined some JSON marshalling, which cuts memory consumption in half.  
* ðŸš€ Authentication tokens are now simpler to manage.
* ðŸš€ Kubernetes Pods are automatically tagged to identify the Podâ€™s namespace, so you can easily build policies around the Pod.

And more! The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
