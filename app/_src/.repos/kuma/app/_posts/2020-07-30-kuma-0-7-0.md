We are happy to announce the general availability of Kuma 0.7! This is very big release that includes countless improvements and updates, specifically when it comes to multi-zone deployments configuration and Kubernetes deployments. We strongly suggest to upgrade to this new version while paying attention to a few breaking changes that 0.7 introduces.

## Notable Improvements in 0.7

- A new “Zone” resource to add remote CPs without restarting the global CP
- An upgraded ProxyTemplate policy to enable better fine-tuning of the underlying Envoy filters
- Support for StatefulSets to run a service mesh across every service like RabbitMQ and Cassandra
- Upgraded “kuma-dp” to Envoy v1.15 (which also unlocks dynamic tracing configuration)
- A new “kuma.io/\*” prefix for Kuma tags like “kuma.io/service”, “kuma.io.protocol” and “kuma.io/zone”
- Numerous bug fixes and improvements

For a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/0ec42aa981139b1552e695b17e0f474cd0d5bde9/CHANGELOG.md).

## Kuma Multi-Zone Deployment

Since version 0.6.0, Kuma supports multi-zone deployments to run a service mesh across multiple clouds, multiple clusters and even multiple architectures (Kubernetes + VMs). When Kuma is deployed in a multi-zone deployment mode, it supports global/remote control plane replication, automatic service discovery, and abstracted connectivity from one zone to another.

Engineered with enterprise architects in mind, the Kuma community has built a powerful architecture to support every team in the organization in a way that no other service mesh can match: give it a try.

## Kuma is a CNCF Sandbox Project

In case you missed the news, Kuma is now a CNCF donated project and the 1st Envoy-based Service Mesh to be part of the foundation! CNCF is a neutral home for Kuma and we welcome contributors to help make Kuma the best Service Mesh available in the landscape.
