We are happy to announce a new major release of Kuma! Kuma 1.3 ships with **10+ new features** and countless improvements. We strongly suggest to upgrade, in order to take advantage of the latest and greatest when it comes to service mesh.

## Features

* ðŸš€ We are finally shipping a service map topology view that will visualize all of our service traffic dependencies in a visual way, with information such as number of requests and error rates. This new feature ships as a new official Grafana dashboard and can be automatically installed by running `kumactl install metrics`:

* ðŸš€ Kuma finally supports mTLS in "permissive" mode, in addition to the traditional "strict" mode. This new mode allows for an easier migration of existing applications into the service mesh, by allowing more flexibility into how the data plane proxy certificates are being validated on incoming requests. Below an example on Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mesh
metadata:
  name: default
spec:
  mtls:
    enabledBackend: ca-1
    backends:
      - name: ca-1
        type: builtin
        mode: PERMISSIVE # or STRICT
```

* ðŸš€ A new "Virtual Outbound" policy to customize hostnames and ports when communicating with data plane proxies.
* We have improved support for intermediate CAs when using mTLS.
* Improved SNI support for ExternalServices.

And a lot more! The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
