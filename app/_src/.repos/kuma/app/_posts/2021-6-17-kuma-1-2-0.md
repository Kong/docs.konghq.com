We are happy to announce a new major release of Kuma! Kuma 1.2 ships with **20 new features** and countless improvements. We strongly suggest to upgrade, in order to take advantage of the latest and greatest when it comes to service mesh.

## Features

* ðŸš€ New L7 Traffic Routing policy to route - and modify - HTTP traffic per path, method, header or any other combination, with support for regex. Traffic can be modified before reaching the final destination too. This feature works in addition to the existing L4 traffic routing that Kuma provides. For example, route all `/bar` traffic to a `foo` service with:

```yaml
type: TrafficRoute
name: l7-http-route
mesh: default
sources:
- match:
    kuma.io/service: '*'
destinations:
- match:
    kuma.io/service: '*'
conf:
  http:
  - match:
      method: GET
      path:
        prefix: /foo
    modify:
      path:
        rewritePrefix: /
    destination:
      kuma.io/service: foo
```

With this feature, it's also easy to implement feature flagging across different versions of our services.

* ðŸš€ New Rate-Limit policy to protect our services from aggressive traffic, therefore protecting them from downtimes and improving the overall reliability of the applications. For example, we can rate-limit all request to the `backend` service with:

```yaml
apiVersion: kuma.io/v1alpha1
kind: RateLimit
mesh: default
metadata:
  name: rate-limit-all-to-backend
spec:
  sources:
    - match:
        kuma.io/service: '*'
  destinations:
    - match:
        kuma.io/service: backend
  conf:
    http:
      requests: 5
      interval: 10s
```

* ðŸš€ The "Remote" control planes have been renamed to "Zone" control planes, and by doing so we have renamed the "Ingress" resource into "ZoneIngress". This change was made after hearing the feedback of many users in the community that wanted more clarity in the naming of this resource.
* ðŸš€ Traffic Permissions now work with External Services.
* ðŸš€ Improved performance of our DNS resolution.
* Countless improvements, including a fix for GCP/GKE's erratic IPv6 support.
* Updated to Envoy 1.18.3.

And a lot more! The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
