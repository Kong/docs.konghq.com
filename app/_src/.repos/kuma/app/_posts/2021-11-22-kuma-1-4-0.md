We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma! Kuma 1.4.0 is an new major release that ships with 25+ new features and significant performance improvements at scale. We strongly suggest to upgrade, in order to take advantage of the latest and greatest when it comes to service mesh.

## Notable Features

* ðŸš€ Performance is significantly improved, with ability to load 2x more data plane proxies, and less CPU consumption.
* ðŸš€ The number of Postgres connections is now limited to 50 by default. The default value was previously unlimited; you can still configure the limit if needed.
* ðŸš€ You can now disable zones as needed.
* ðŸš€ You can now select a specific zone in the "Kuma Service" dashboard and in the "Service to Service" dashboard.
* Internal DNS now properly resolves AAAA records.
* Improvements to the GUI and its sidebar menu.

And a lot more! The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## Performance Improvements

This release includes performance improvements that have been identified by our new performance suite which replicates a Kuma deployment at scale. This allows us to anticipate some performance issues that you may be experiencing in production and ship a fix as part of our continuous improvements to the product.

Particularly, we have reduced the likelihood of overwhelming the underlying Postgres database in `universal` mode, and we are making incremental improvements to the CPU and memory consumption of Kuma. These performance improvements are our top priority, so please reach out to the maintainers if you would like to report any issue running Kuma at scale.
