We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma! Kuma 1.3.1 ships with new features, performance improvements, and bug fixes. We strongly suggest to upgrade, in order to take advantage of the latest and greatest when it comes to service mesh.

## Features

* ðŸš€ You can now disable zones as needed.
* ðŸš€ You can now select a specific zone in the Kuma Service dashboard and in the Service to Service dashboard.
* ðŸš€ The number of Postgres connections is now limited to 50 by default. The default value was previously unlimited; you can still configure the limit if needed.
* Performance is significantly improved.
* Internal DNS now properly resolves AAAA records.

And a lot more! The full changelog is available [here](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
