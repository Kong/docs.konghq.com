We are happy to announce the release of Kuma 1.0.2 with a few improvements and fixes, and we suggest to upgrade to start using the greatest and latest. This is a minor update on top of Kuma 1.0 that shipped last week [with over 70+ features and improvements](https://kuma.io/blog/2020/kuma-1-0-0/).

## Notable Improvements in 1.0.2

- Added the Services view (Internal and External) to the GUI.
- Updated Envoy to 1.16.1
- Improvements to the DNS resolver in multi-zone deployments.
- Fixes to the virtual probes.
- And more!

For a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/0ec42aa981139b1552e695b17e0f474cd0d5bde9/CHANGELOG.md).

## Services View

In this new release, we are finally providing a visual interface to both internal and external services in Kuma, that will work alongside the data plane proxy view you are already familiar with:
