We are happy to announce the release of Kuma 1.0.1 with a few improvements and fixes, and we suggest to upgrade to start using the greatest and latest. This is a minor update on top of Kuma 1.0 that shipped last week [with over 70+ features and improvements](https://kuma.io/blog/2020/kuma-1-0-0/).

## Notable Improvements in 1.0.1

- Improvements on virtual probes with multiple sidecars.
- Improvements on the auto-generated TrafficRoute introduced in 1.0.
- Updates and fixes in the GUI, in the Ingress section and elsewhere.
- And more!

## Join us on the community call!

Join us on our [community channels](https://kuma.io/community/) to learn more about Kuma, including our official Slack chat. The community channels are useful to get up and running with Kuma, as well as to learn how to contribute to and discuss the project roadmap. Kuma is a CNCF Sandbox project: neutral, open and inclusive.

The next community call will be hosted on [November 25th at 8:30am PST](https://kuma.io/community/). Also donâ€™t forget to follow Kuma [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kumamesh) and star it [on GitHub](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma)!

## Upgrading

Be sure to carefully read the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/UPGRADE.md) before upgrading Kuma.
