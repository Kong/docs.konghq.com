We are happy to announce the release of Kuma 1.0.3 with one improvement only when it comes to timeouts. In the next release we will introduce a formal policy for managing request timeouts in a more fine grained way.

Therefore - although we always recommend upgrading to the latest and greatest - you can postpone upgrading to this version if you have not experienced any problem with request timeouts.

## Improvements in 1.0.3

- Disabling timeouts on the route level.

For a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/0ec42aa981139b1552e695b17e0f474cd0d5bde9/CHANGELOG.md).

## Upgrading

Be sure to carefully read the [Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/master/UPGRADE.md) before upgrading Kuma.
