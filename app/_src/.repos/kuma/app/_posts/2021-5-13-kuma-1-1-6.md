We are happy to announce a new release of Kuma that ships with support for all tags in Traffic Permission policies, simultaneous TCP and HTTP health checks, Gateway mode, bug fixes, and much more!

## Features

- ðŸš€ You can now specify any and all tags in a `TrafficPermission` policy.
- ðŸš€ You can now specify TCP and HTTP health checks at the same time in the same policy. The health check policy also now includes a `reuse_connection` option.
- ðŸš€ The `--gateway` flag is now available in the CLI.
- ðŸš€ We have added support for ingress controller installation from `kumactl`. The first ingress controller supported is Kong Gateway.
- You can now install the Kuma demo application with the CLI.
