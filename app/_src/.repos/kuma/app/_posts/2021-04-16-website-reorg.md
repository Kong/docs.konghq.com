The Kuma documentation is now simplified on the website. We're publishing only the most recent versions (currently versions 1.1.0 - 1.1.3). This means simpler navigation, and encourages you to keep up with the latest features and improvements.

If you still need docs for older versions, you can find the raw markdown in the website repository at the following locations:

- [Versions 1.0.0 - 1.0.8](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-website/tree/docs/release-1.0.x/docs/docs)
- [Versions 0.1.0 - 0.7.3](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma-website/tree/docs/release-0.x.x/docs/docs)
