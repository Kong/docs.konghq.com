We are happy to announce the release of Kuma 0.5.1! This is a minor release that ships with improvements and bug fixes.

## Notable Improvements

- Circuit Breaking has been decoupled from Health Checks and it is now in its own policy.
- Several improvements in the GUI.
- Prometheus metrics can now be retrieved over mTLS.
- Several bug fixes and improvements.
  For a complete list of features and updates, take a look at the [full changelog](https://github.com/kumahq/kuma/blob/0ec42aa981139b1552e695b17e0f474cd0d5bde9/CHANGELOG.md).

## Advanced Circuit Breakers

While circuit breakers could already be implemented by using passive health checks, we decided to extract them in their own “Circuit Breaker” policy and – while doing so – also extend their configuration with more advanced features (like Split Mode). You can find this new policy in the [Policies](https://kuma.io/policies/) page.

Circuit breaking will be removed from the “Health Check” policy in the next version of Kuma.
