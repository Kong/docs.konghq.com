Any changes or modifications will be effective 7 days after Kong Inc. provides notice that these Terms have been modified (the “Notice Period”). Your continued use of the Service following the Notice Period will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications. You are advised to review these Terms whenever you access the Service and at least every 30 days to make sure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply to your use of the Service.

SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

**ARBITRATION**

**PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH KONG INC. AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM KONG INC.**

In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating in any way to these Terms or the Service, you and Kong Inc. agree to consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing your mutual interests, try to reach a solution satisfactory to both parties. If we do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then either of us may, by notice to the other demand mediation under the mediation rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco, California. We both give up our right to litigate our disputes and may not proceed to arbitration without first trying mediation, but you and Kong Inc. are NOT required to arbitrate any dispute in which either party seeks equitable and other relief from the alleged unlawful use of copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents. Except as otherwise required under applicable law, you and Kong Inc. intend and agree: (a) not to assert class action or representative action procedures and agree that they will not apply in any arbitration involving the other; (b) not to assert class action or representative action claims against the other in arbitration or otherwise; and (c) will only submit individual claims in arbitration and will not seek to represent the interests of any other person or entity.

If settlement is not reached within 60 days after service of a written demand for mediation, any unresolved controversy or claim will be resolved by arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association before a single arbitrator in San Francisco, California. The language of all proceedings and filings will be English. The arbitrator will render a written opinion including findings of fact and law and the award and/or determination of the arbitrator will be binding on the parties, and their respective administrators and assigns, and will not be subject to appeal. Judgment may be entered upon the award of the arbitrator in any court of competent jurisdiction. The expenses of the arbitration will be shared equally by the parties unless the arbitration determines that the expenses will be otherwise assessed and the prevailing party may be awarded its attorneys’ fees and expenses by the arbitrator. It is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will be concluded within 90 days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may extend this time limit only if failure to do so would unduly prejudice the rights of the parties. Failure to adhere to this time limit will not constitute a basis for challenging the award. Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable production of relevant, non-privileged documents, carried out expeditiously.

**MISCELLANEOUS**

**Independent Contractors**

Neither party will, for any purpose, be deemed to be an agent, franchisor, franchise, employee, representative, owner, or partner of the other party, and the relationship between the parties will only be that of independent contractors. Neither party will have any right or authority to assume or create any obligations or to make any representations or warranties on behalf of any other party, whether express or implied, or to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.

**Assignment**

You may not assign, delegate, or transfer (by sale, merger, operation of law, or otherwise) these Terms or any right, title, interest, or obligation hereunder without the prior written consent of Kong Inc. Any attempted or purported assignment, delegation, or transfer in violation of the foregoing will be null and void and without effect. Kong Inc. may assign these Terms without your prior written consent. These Terms will be binding and inure to the benefit of such assignees, transferees, and other successors in the interest of the parties in the event of an assignment or other transfer made consistent with the provisions of these Terms.

**Third-Party Infrastructure**

Notwithstanding any terms to the contrary in these Terms, you acknowledge and agree that Kong Inc. uses a third-party hosting infrastructure in connection with the Services (“Third-Party Infrastructure”), the provider(s) of the Third-Party Infrastructure disclaim and make no representation or warranty with respect to such Third-Party Infrastructure, and Kong Inc. assumes no liability for any claim that may arise with respect to such Third-Party Infrastructure.

**Electronic Communications**

By using the Service, you agree that we may communicate with you electronically regarding your use of the Service and that any notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including, without limitation, that the communications be in writing. To withdraw your consent from receiving electronic notice, please notify us at [support@konghq.com](mailto:support@konghq.com).

**Severability**

If any provision of these Terms is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other provisions of these Terms will nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal substance of the transactions contemplated by these Terms is not affected in any manner adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties will negotiate in good faith to modify these Terms so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled.

**Precedence**

Your use of a Service of Kong Inc. may be subject to a separate agreement between you and Kong Inc. If any of the terms of such separate agreement conflict with any of the terms of these Terms, the terms of such separate agreement will govern to the extent of such conflict.

**Force Majeure**

Kong Inc. is not responsible for any failure to perform or delay attributable in whole or in part to any cause beyond its reasonable control including, but not limited to, acts of God (fire, storm, floods, earthquakes, etc.), acts of terrorism, civil disturbances, disruption of telecommunications, disruption of power or other essential services, interruption or termination of services provided by any service providers used by Kong Inc., labor disturbances, vandalism, cable cut, computer viruses or other similar occurrences, or any malicious or unlawful acts of any third party.
