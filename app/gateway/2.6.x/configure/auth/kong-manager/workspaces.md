title: Configure Workspaces in Kong Manager
badge: enterprise
---

**Workspaces** enable an organization to segment traffic so that
teams of **Admins** sharing the same Kong cluster are only able to
interact with entities from their groups. Within a **Workspace**,
it is possible to invite **Admins** to a particular team and to
enforce **RBAC** with **Roles** and **Permissions** that further
delimit the types of actions and entities available to an **Admin**.

## Prerequisites

* [`enforce_rbac = on`](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/reference/configuration/#enforce_rbac)
* {{site.base_gateway}} has [started](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/plan-and-deploy/security/start-kong-securely)
* Logged in to Kong Manager as a **Super Admin**

## Default Workspace

When the first **Super Admin** logs in, they begin in the **Workspace**
named **default**. From here, they may invite **Admins** who are
intended to be able to manage all other **Workspaces**, as well as
the **Workspaces** themselves.

## Navigating across Workspaces in Kong Manager

To navigate between Workspaces from the **Overview** page, click on any
Workspace displayed beneath the **Vitals** chart.

The list of **Workspaces** may be rendered as cards or a table,
depending on preference.

## Creating New Workspaces

This guide describes how to create **Workspaces** in Kong
Manager. As an alternative, if a **Super Admin** wants to create
a **Workspace** with the Admin API, it is possible to do so
using the [`/workspaces/` route](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/admin-api/workspaces/reference/#add-workspace).

1. Log in as the **Super Admin**. On the **Workspaces** page, click the **New Workspace**
button at the top right to see the **Create Workspace** form. Name and choose a
color / icon for the new Workspace.

    Each **Workspace** name should be unique,
    regardless of letter case. For example, naming one
    **Workspace** "Payments" and another one "payments" will
    create two different workspaces that appear identical.

    Do not name Workspaces the same as these major routes in Kong
    Manager:

    ```
    • Admins
    • Certificates
    • Consumers
    • Plugins
    • Portal
    • Routes
    • Services
    • SNIs
    • Upstreams
    • Vitals
    ```

2. Click the "Create New Workspace" button. Upon creation, the application will
navigate to the new Workspace's dashboard.

## Delete or Edit a Workspace

To delete a Workspace, everything inside the
Workspace must be deleted first. This includes default Roles on the "Admins"
page.

1. Within the Workspace, navigate to the "Dashboard" page.

2. At the top right, click the "Settings" button.

3. Edit or delete the Workspace.


## Workspace Access

If a **Role** does not have permission to access entire endpoints within
a **Workspace**, the **Admin** assigned to that **Role** will not be
able to see the related navigation links.

To set up access:
1. Open Kong Manager.
2. On the left sidebar, click the **Admins** link in the
**Security** section.

  If the sidebar is collapsed, hover over
  the **security badge icon** at the bottom and click the
  **Admins** link.

The **Admins** page displays a list of current **Admins** and
**Roles**. Four default **Roles** specific to the new
**Workspace** are already visible, and new **Roles** specific
to the **Workspace** can be assigned from this page.

For more information about **Admins** and **Roles**, see
[RBAC in Kong Manager](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/configure/auth/rbac/).
