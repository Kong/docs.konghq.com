To enable Enterprise features, {{site.base_gateway}} requires a license file.
You will receive this file from Kong when you sign up for a
{{site.konnect_product_name}} Enterprise subscription.

[Contact Kong](https://konghq.com/get-started) for more information.

{:.note}
> **Note:** The free mode does not require a license. See
[{{site.base_gateway}} Licensing](/gateway/{{page.release}}/plan-and-deploy/licenses/)
for a feature comparison.

Once a license has been deployed to a {{site.base_gateway}} node, retrieve it
using the [`/licenses` Admin API endpoint](/gateway/{{page.release}}/admin-api/licenses/examples/).

If you have purchased a subscription but haven't received a license file,
contact your sales representative.
