Client information module.

 A set of functions to retrieve information about the client connecting to
 Kong in the context of a given request.

 See also:
 [nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html)



## kong.client.get_ip()

Returns the remote address of the client making the request.  This module
 **always** returns the address of the client directly connecting to Kong.
 That is, in cases when a load balancer is in front of Kong, this function
 returns the load balancer's address, and **not** that of the
 downstream client.


**Phases**

* certificate, rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log

**Returns**

* `string`:  The remote IP address of the client making the request.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a client with IP 127.0.0.1 making connection through
-- a load balancer with IP 10.0.0.1 to Kong answering the request for
-- https://example.com:1234/v1/movies
kong.client.get_ip() -- "10.0.0.1"
```



## kong.client.get_forwarded_ip()

Returns the remote address of the client making the request.  Unlike
 `kong.client.get_ip`, this function will consider forwarded addresses in
 cases when a load balancer is in front of Kong. Whether this function
 returns a forwarded address or not depends on several Kong configuration
 parameters:

 * [trusted\_ips](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#trusted_ips)
 * [real\_ip\_header](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_header)
 * [real\_ip\_recursive](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_recursive)


**Phases**

* certificate, rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log

**Returns**

* `string`:   The remote IP address of the client making the request,
 considering forwarded addresses.



**Usage**

``` lua
-- Given a client with IP 127.0.0.1 making connection through
-- a load balancer with IP 10.0.0.1 to Kong answering the request for
-- https://username:password@example.com:1234/v1/movies

kong.client.get_forwarded_ip() -- "127.0.0.1"

-- Note: This example assumes that 10.0.0.1 is one of the trusted IPs, and that
-- the load balancer adds the right headers matching with the configuration
-- of `real_ip_header`, e.g. `proxy_protocol`.
```



## kong.client.get_port()

Returns the remote port of the client making the request.  This
 **always** returns the port of the client directly connecting to Kong. That
 is, in cases when a load balancer is in front of Kong, this function
 returns the load balancer's port, and **not** that of the downstream client.

**Phases**

* certificate, rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log

**Returns**

* `number`:  The remote client port.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- [client]:40000 <-> 80:[balancer]:30000 <-> 80:[kong]:20000 <-> 80:[service]
kong.client.get_port() -- 30000
```



## kong.client.get_forwarded_port()

Returns the remote port of the client making the request.  Unlike
 `kong.client.get_port`, this function will consider forwarded ports in cases
 when a load balancer is in front of Kong. Whether this function returns a
 forwarded port or not depends on several Kong configuration parameters:

 * [trusted\_ips](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#trusted_ips)
 * [real\_ip\_header](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_header)
 * [real\_ip\_recursive](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#real_ip_recursive)

**Phases**

* certificate, rewrite, access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log

**Returns**

* `number`:  The remote client port, considering forwarded ports.


**Usage**

``` lua
-- [client]:40000 <-> 80:[balancer]:30000 <-> 80:[kong]:20000 <-> 80:[service]
kong.client.get_forwarded_port() -- 40000

-- Note: This example assumes that [balancer] is one of the trusted IPs, and that
-- the load balancer adds the right headers matching with the configuration
-- of `real_ip_header`, e.g. `proxy_protocol`.
```



## kong.client.get_credential()

Returns the credentials of the currently authenticated consumer.
 If not set yet, it returns `nil`.

**Phases**

* access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log

**Returns**

* `string`:  The authenticated credential.


**Usage**

``` lua
local credential = kong.client.get_credential()
if credential then
  consumer_id = credential.consumer_id
else
  -- request not authenticated yet
end
```



## kong.client.load_consumer(consumer_id[, search_by_username])

Returns the consumer from the datastore.
 Looks up the consumer by ID, and can optionally do a second search by name.

**Phases**

* access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log

**Parameters**

* **consumer_id** (`string`):  The consumer ID to look up.
* **search_by_username** (`boolean`, _optional_):  If truthy,
 and if the consumer is not found by ID,
 then a second search by username will be performed.

**Returns**

1.  `table|nil`:  Consumer entity or `nil`.

1.  `nil|err`:  `nil` if successful, or an error message if it fails.


**Usage**

``` lua
local consumer_id = "john_doe"
local consumer = kong.client.load_consumer(consumer_id, true)
```



## kong.client.get_consumer()

Returns the `consumer` entity of the currently authenticated consumer.
 If not set yet, it returns `nil`.

**Phases**

* access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log

**Returns**

* `table`:  The authenticated consumer entity.


**Usage**

``` lua
local consumer = kong.client.get_consumer()
if consumer then
  consumer_id = consumer.id
else
  -- request not authenticated yet, or a credential
  -- without a consumer (external auth)
end
```



## kong.client.authenticate(consumer, credential)

Sets the authenticated consumer and/or credential for the current request.
 While both `consumer` and `credential` can be `nil`,
 at least one of them must exist. Otherwise, this function will throw an
 error.

**Phases**

* access

**Parameters**

* **consumer** (`table|nil`):  The consumer to set. If no
 value is provided, then any existing value will be cleared.
* **credential** (`table|nil`):  The credential to set. If
 no value is provided, then any existing value will be cleared.

**Usage**

``` lua
-- assuming `credential` and `consumer` have been set by some authentication code
kong.client.authenticate(consumer, credentials)
```



## kong.client.get_protocol([allow_terminated])

Returns the protocol matched by the current route (`"http"`, `"https"`, `"tcp"` or
 `"tls"`), or `nil`, if no route has been matched, which can happen when dealing with
 erroneous requests.

**Phases**

* access, header_filter, response, body_filter, log

**Parameters**

* **allow_terminated** (`boolean`, _optional_):  If set, the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header is checked when checking for HTTPS.

**Returns**

1.  `string|nil`:  Can be one of `"http"`, `"https"`, `"tcp"`, `"tls"` or `nil`.

1.  `nil|err`:  `nil` if successful, or an error message if it fails.


**Usage**

``` lua
kong.client.get_protocol() -- "http"
```
