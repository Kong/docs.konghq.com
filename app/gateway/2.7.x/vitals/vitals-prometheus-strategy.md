This document covers integrating Kong Vitals with a new or existing Prometheus
time-series server or cluster. Leveraging a time-series database for Vitals data
can improve request and Vitals performance in very-high traffic {{site.base_gateway}}
clusters (such as environments handling tens or hundreds of thousands of
requests per second), without placing addition write load on the database
backing the Kong cluster.

    <strong>Deprecation:</strong> 
    Support for Cassandra is deprecated with <code>Kong Gateway</code> 2.7 and fully removed with 4.0. It is strongly discouraged to use Cassandra as your datastore as it will have limited support throughout the deprecation period. For more
    information, see <a href="/gateway-oss/{{ link_to_cassandra_deprecation_overview }}">this blog post</a>.

For using Vitals with a database as the backend (i.e. PostgreSQL, Cassandra),
refer to [Kong Vitals](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/vitals/).

## Lifecycle Overview

Kong Vitals integrates with Prometheus using an intermediary data exporter, the [Prometheus StatsD exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter).
This integration allows Kong to efficiently ship Vitals metrics to an outside process where data points
can be aggregated and made available for consumption by Prometheus, without impeding performance
within the Kong proxy itself. In this design, Kong writes Vitals metrics to the StatsD exporter
as [StatsD metrics](https://github.com/statsd/statsd/blob/master/docs/metric_types.md). Prometheus
scrapes this exporter as it would any other endpoint. Kong then queries Prometheus to retrieve and
display Vitals data via the API and Kong Manager. Prometheus does not ever directly scrape the Kong
nodes for time series data. A trivialized workflow looks as follows:

![Single Node Example Data Flow](/assets/images/docs/ee/vitals-prometheus/single.png)

It is not uncommon to separate Kong functionality amongst a cluster of nodes. For example,
one or more nodes serve only proxy traffic, while another node is responsible for serving the
Kong Admin API and Kong Manager. In this case, the node responsible for proxy traffic writes
the data to a StatsD exporter, and the node responsible for Admin API reads from Prometheus:

![Multi Node Example Data Flow](/assets/images/docs/ee/vitals-prometheus/read-write.png)

In either case, the StatsD exporter process can be run either as a standalone process/container
or as a sidecar/adjacent process within a VM. Note that in high-traffic environments, data aggregation
within the StatsD exporter process can cause significant CPU usage. In such cases, we recommend to
run Kong and StatsD processes on separate hardware/VM/container environments to avoid saturating CPU usage.

## Set up Prometheus environment for Vitals

### Download Prometheus

The latest release of Prometheus can be found at the [Prometheus download page](https://prometheus.io/download/#prometheus).

Prometheus should be running on a separate node from the one running Kong.
For users that are already using Prometheus in their infrastructure, it's
possible to use existing Prometheus nodes as Vitals storage backend.

In this guide, we assume Prometheus is running on hostname `prometheus-node`
using default config that listens on port `9090`.

### Download and configure StatsD exporter

StatsD exporter is distributed as a Docker image. Pull the latest version
with the following command:

```sh
docker pull kong/statsd-exporter-advanced:0.3.1
```

The binary includes features like min/max gauges and Unix domain
socket support.

StatsD exporter needed to configured with a set of mapping rules to translate
the StatsD UDP events to Prometheus metrics. A default set of mapping rules can
be downloaded at
[statsd.rules.yaml](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/statsd.rules.yaml).
Then start StatsD exporter with

```bash
./statsd_exporter --statsd.mapping-config=statsd.rules.yaml \
                    --statsd.listen-unixgram=''
```

The StatsD mapping rules file must be configured to match the metrics sent from
Kong. To learn how to customize the StatsD events name, please refer to
[Enable Vitals with Prometheus strategy in Kong](#enable-vitals-with-prometheus-strategy-in-kong)
section.

StatsD exporter can run either on a separate node from Kong (to avoid resource
competition with Kong), or on the same host with Kong (to reduce unnecessary
network overhead).

In this guide, we assume StatsD exporter is running on hostname `statsd-node`,
using default config that listens to UDP traffic on port `9125` and the metrics
in Prometheus Exposition Format are exposed on port `9102`.

### Configure Prometheus to scrape StatsD exporter

To configure Prometheus to scrape StatsD exporter, add the following section to
`scrape_configs` in `prometheus.yaml`.

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'vitals_statsd_exporter'
    scrape_interval: "5s"
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['statsd-node:9102']
```

Please update `statsd-node` with the actual hostname that runs StatsD exporter.

If you are using service discovery, it will be more convenient to configure
multiple StatsD exporters in Prometheus. Please refer to the
[scape_configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#%3Cscrape_config%3E)
section of Prometheus document for further reading.

By default, the Vitals graph in Kong Manager uses the configured target address
in the legend, which is named `instance` in the Prometheus metrics label. For some service
discovery setups where `instance` is `IP:PORT`, the user might want to relabel the `instance`
label to display a more meaningful hostname in the legend.
To do so, the user can also refer to the [scape_configs](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#%3Cscrape_config%3E)
section and rewrite the `instance` label with the corresponding meta label.

For example, in a Kubernetes environment, use the following relabel rules:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'vitals_statsd_exporter'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      # your SD config to filter statsd exporter pods
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_name]
        action: replace
        target_label: 'instance'
```

### Enable Vitals with Prometheus strategy in Kong

You can change this in your configuration to enable Vitals with Prometheus:

```bash
# via your Kong configuration file
vitals = on
vitals_strategy = prometheus
vitals_statsd_address = statsd-node:9125
vitals_tsdb_address = prometheus-node:9090
```

```bash
# or via environment variables
export KONG_VITALS=on
export KONG_VITALS_STRATEGY=prometheus
export KONG_VITALS_STATSD_ADDRESS=statsd-node:9125
export KONG_VITALS_TSDB_ADDRESS=prometheus-node:9090
```

Please update `statsd-node` and `prometheus-node` with the actual hostname that
runs StatsD exporter and Prometheus.

As with other Kong configurations, your changes take effect on `kong reload` or
`kong restart`.

If you set `scrape_interval` in Prometheus other than the default value of `5`
seconds, you will also need to update the following:

```bash
# via your Kong configuration file
vitals_prometheus_scrape_interval = new_value_in_seconds
```

```bash
# or via environment variables
export KONG_VITALS_PROMETHEUS_SCRAPE_INTERVAL=new_value_in_seconds
```

The above option configures `interval` parameter when querying Prometheus.
The value `new_value_in_seconds` should be equal or larger than
`scrape_interval` config in Prometheus.

You can also configure Kong to send StatsD events with a different prefix from
the default value of `kong`. Make sure the prefix in statsd.rules
is same as that in Kong configuration:

```bash
# via your Kong configuration file
vitals_statsd_prefix = kong-vitals
```

```bash
# or via environment variables
export KONG_VITALS_STATSD_PREFIX=kong-vitals
```

```yaml
# in statsd.rules
mappings:
# by API
- match: kong-vitals.api.*.request.count
  name: "kong_requests_proxy"
  labels:
    job: "kong_metrics"
# follows other metrics
# ...
```

### Install Grafana dashboard

If you use Grafana, you can import the Kong Vitals Prometheus dashboard to visualize the data.

In your Grafana installation, click the **+** button in the sidebar, and choose **Import**.

On the **Import** screen, find the **Grafana.com Dashboard** field and enter `11870`. Then, click **Load**. Optionally, you
can also download the JSON model from [https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11870](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/11870) and import it manually.

On the next screen, select the **Prometheus** datasource that is configured to scrape `statsd-exporter`, then
click **Import**.

## Tuning and Optimization

### StatsD exporter UDP buffer

As the amount of concurrent requests increases, the length of the queue to store
unprocessed UDP events will grow as well.
It's necessary to increase the UDP read buffer size to avoid possible packet
dropping.

To increase the UDP read buffer for the StatsD exporter process, run the binary
using the following example to set read buffer to around 3 MB:

```
./statsd_exporter --statsd.mapping-config=statsd.rules.yaml \
                    --statsd.listen-unixgram='' \
                    --statsd.read-buffer=30000000
```

To increase the UDP read buffer for the host that's running, adding the
following example line to `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
net.core.rmem_max = 60000000
```

And then apply the setting with root privilege:

```
# sysctl -p
```

### StatsD exporter with Unix domain socket

It is possible to further reduce network overhead by deploying StatsD exporter
on the same node with Kong and let the exporter listen on local Unix domain
socket.

```bash
./statsd_exporter --statsd.mapping-config=statsd.rules.yaml \
                    --statsd.read-buffer=30000000 \
                    --statsd.listen-unixgram='/tmp/statsd.sock'
```

By default the socket is created with permission `0755`, so that StatsD exporter
 has to be running with the same user with Kong to allow Kong to write UDP
 packets to the socket. To allow the exporter and Kong to run as different
 users, the socket can be created with permission `0777` with the following:

```bash
./statsd_exporter --statsd.mapping-config=statsd.rules.yaml \
                    --statsd.read-buffer=30000000 \
                    --statsd.listen-unixgram='/tmp/statsd.sock' \
                    --statsd.unixsocket-umask="777"
```

## Exported Metrics

With the above configuration, the Prometheus StatsD exporter will make available all
metrics as provided by the [standard Vitals configuration](/gateway/{{page.kong_version}}/vitals/vitalsSpec.yaml).

Additionally, the exporter process provides access to the default metrics exposed by the [Golang
Prometheus client library](https://prometheus.io/docs/guides/go-application/). These metric names
include the `go_` and `process_` prefixes. These data points are related specifically
to the StatsD exporter process itself, not Kong. Infrastructure teams may find this data
useful, but they are of limited value with respect to monitoring Kong behavior.

## Accessing Vitals metrics from Prometheus

You can also access Kong Vitals metrics in Prometheus and display on Grafana
or setup alerting rules. With the example StatsD mapping rules, all metrics are
labeled with `exported_job=kong_vitals`. With the above Prometheus scrape config
above, all metrics are also labeled with `job=vitals_statsd_exporter`.
