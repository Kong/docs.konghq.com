Kong uses common terms for entities and processes that have a specific meaning in context. This topic provides a conceptual overview of terms, and how they apply to Kong’s use cases.

## Stages of software availability

### Tech preview
A feature that is in tech preview might have limited to no documentation, is not guaranteed to be made available as GA in the future, and should not be deployed to production environments.

### Beta
A Beta designation in Kong software means the functionality of a feature or release version is of high quality and can be deployed in a non-production environment. Note the following when using a Beta feature or version:

* **A Beta feature or version should not be deployed in a production environment.**
* Beta customers are encouraged to engage Kong Support to report issues encountered in Beta testing. Support requests should be filed with normal priority, but contractual SLA’s will not be applicable for Beta features.
* Support is not available for data recovery, rollback, or other tasks when using a Beta feature or version.
* User documentation might not be available, complete, or reflect entire functionality.

A Beta feature or version is made available to the general public for usability testing and to gain feedback about the feature or version before releasing it as a production-ready, stable feature or version.

### General availability
General availability, or GA, means that the software is released publically and
is supported according to Kong's [support and maintenance policy](https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Kong-Support-and-Maintenance-Policy-16-April-2021.pdf).
