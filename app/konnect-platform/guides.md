{{site.konnect_product_name}} is a versatile platform. To get started, choose
your deployment type:

* **{{site.konnect_saas}} deployment**: Let Kong host the control plane
and you only need to provide the data plane node. Spin up a simple
{{site.base_gateway}} runtime with Docker, create a service, and implement it
in minutes. See the
[{{site.konnect_saas}} quickstart guide](/konnect/getting-started/) to get
started.

* **Self-hosted deployment**:
Install {{site.base_gateway}}, then use the {{site.base_gateway}} guide for a
detailed walkthrough of foundational API gateway concepts, features, and
capabilities.
    * For a traditional deployment, see the [Kong gateway installation guides](/gateway/latest/install-and-run).
    * For a hybrid mode deployment, use the [hybrid mode post-installation instructions](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/hybrid-mode/hybrid-mode-setup).
    * Once everything is installed, check out the
    [self-hosted getting started guide](/gateway/latest/get-started/comprehensive).
