# Datastores

Technically Kong can be expanded to support many different datastores. Although this is a possiblity, for the time being we'll provide support for Apache Cassandra, which is also the best option for starting small and scaling big.

In the future we may introduce support for SQL datastores like MySQL or Posgres, or for NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
