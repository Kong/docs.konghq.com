# Kong Admin API

Kong comes with an **internal** RESTful Admin API for administration purposes.
Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will
keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

- `8001` is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
- `8444` is the default port for HTTPS traffic to the Admin API.

This API is designed for internal use and provides full control over Kong, so
care should be taken when setting up Kong environments to avoid undue public
exposure of this API. See [this document][secure-admin-api] for a discussion
of methods to secure the Admin API.

## Supported Content Types

The Admin API accepts 2 content types on every endpoint:

- **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**

Simple enough for basic request bodies, you will probably use it most of the time. Note that when sending nested values, Kong expects nested objects to be referenced with dotted keys. Example:

```
config.limit=10&config.period=seconds
```

- **application/json**

Handy for complex bodies (ex: complex plugin configuration), in that case simply send a JSON representation of the data you want to send. Example:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "limit": 10,
        "period": "seconds"
    }
}
```

## Information routes

### Retrieve node information

Retrieve generic details about a node.

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint get">/</div>

#### Response

```
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "hostname": "",
    "lua_version": "LuaJIT 2.1.0-alpha",
    "plugins": {
        "available_on_server": [
            ...
        ],
        "enabled_in_cluster": [

}
```

* `available_on_server`: Names of plugins that are installed on the node.
* `enabled_in_cluster`: Names of plugins that are enabled/configured. That is, the plugins configurations currently in the datastore shared by all Kong nodes.

---

### Retrieve node status

Retrieve usage information about a node, with some basic information about the connections being processed by the underlying nginx process, and the status of the database connection.

If you want to monitor the Kong process, since Kong is built on top of nginx, every existing nginx monitoring tool or agent can be used.

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint get">/status</div>

#### Response

```
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "server": {
        "total_requests": 3,
        "connections_active": 1,
        "connections_accepted": 1,
        "connections_handled": 1,
        "connections_reading": 0,
        "connections_writing": 1,
        "connections_waiting": 0
    },
    "database": {
        "reachable": true
    }
}
```

* `server`: Metrics about the nginx HTTP/S server.
    * `total_requests`: The total number of client requests.
    * `connections_active`: The current number of active client connections including Waiting connections.
    * `connections_accepted`: The total number of accepted client connections.
    * `connections_handled`: The total number of handled connections. Generally, the parameter value is the same as accepts unless some resource limits have been reached.
    * `connections_reading`: The current number of connections where Kong is reading the request header.
    * `connections_writing`: The current number of connections where nginx is writing the response back to the client.
    * `connections_waiting`: The current number of idle client connections waiting for a request.
* `database`: Metrics about the database.
    * `reachable`: A boolean value reflecting the state of the database connection. Please note that this flag **does not** reflect the health of the database itself.

## API Object

The API object describes an API that's being exposed by Kong. Kong needs to know how to retrieve the 
API when a consumer is calling it from the Proxy port. Each API object must specify some combination 
of `hosts`, `uris`, and `methods`. Kong will proxy all requests to the API to the specified upstream URL.

```json
{

The behavior of `PUT` endpoints is the following: if the request payload **does
not** contain an entity's primary key (`id` for APIs), the entity will be
created with the given payload. If the request payload **does** contain an
entity's primary key, the payload will "replace" the entity specified by the
given primary key. If the primary key is **not** that of an existing entity, `404
NOT FOUND` will be returned.

## Plugin Object

A Plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed during
the HTTP request/response lifecycle. It is how you can add functionalities
to APIs that run behind Kong, like Authentication or Rate Limiting for
example. You can find more information about how to install and what values
each plugin takes by visiting the [Plugins Gallery](/plugins).

When adding a Plugin Configuration to an API, every request made by a client to
that API will run said Plugin. If a Plugin needs to be tuned to different
values for some specific Consumers, you can do so by specifying the
`consumer_id` value:

```json
{
    "id": "4d924084-1adb-40a5-c042-63b19db421d1",
    "api_id": "5fd1z584-1adb-40a5-c042-63b19db49x21",
    "consumer_id": "a3dX2dh2-1adb-40a5-c042-63b19dbx83hF4",
    "name": "rate-limiting",
    "config": {
        "minute": 20,
        "hour": 500
    },
    "enabled": true,
    "created_at": 1422386534
}
```

See the [Precedence](#precedence) section below for more details.

#### Precedence

Plugins can be added globally (all APIs), on a single API, single Consumer,
or a combination of both an API and a Consumer. Additionally, a given plugin
(e.g. `key-auth`) will only run once per request, even if it is configured
twice (e.g. globally *and* on an API).

Therefore, there exists an order of precedence when the same plugin is applied
to different entities with different configurations. This order implies that
such a plugin that is configured twice, will only run once.

The order of precedence is, from highest to lowest:

1. Plugins applied on a combination of an API and a Consumer (if the request is
   authenticated).
2. Plugins applied to a Consumer (if the request is authenticated).
3. Plugins applied to an API.
4. Plugins configured to run globally.

**Example**: if the `rate-limiting` plugin is applied twice (with different
configurations): for an API (Plugin config A), and for a Consumer (Plugin
config B), then requests authenticating this Consumer will run Plugin config B
and ignore A (2.). However, requests that do not authenticate this Consumer
will fallback to running Plugin config A (3.).

This behavior is particularly useful when the intent is to override the
configuration of a particular plugin (e.g. allow a higher rate limiting) for a
given API or Consumer.

---

### Add Plugin

You can add a plugin in four different ways:

* For every API and Consumer. Don't set `api_id` and `consumer_id`.
* For every API and a specific Consumer. Only set `consumer_id`.
* For every Consumer and a specific API. Only set `api_id`.
* For a specific Consumer and API. Set both `api_id` and `consumer_id`.

Note that not all plugins allow to specify `consumer_id`. Check the plugin documentation.

## Certificate Object

A certificate object represents a public certificate/private key pair for an SSL
certificate. These objects are used by Kong to handle SSL/TLS termination for
encrypted requests. Certificates are optionally associated with SNI objects to
tie a cert/key pair to one or more hostnames.

```json
{
    "cert": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...",
    "key": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----..."
}
```

## SNI Objects

An SNI object represents a many-to-one mapping of hostnames to a certificate.
That is, a certificate object can have many hostnames associated with it; when
Kong receives an SSL request, it uses the SNI field in the Client Hello to
lookup the certificate object based on the SNI associated with the certificate.

```json
{
    "name": "example.com",
    "ssl_certificate_id": "21b69eab-09d9-40f9-a55e-c4ee47fada68"

## Upstream Objects

The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to loadbalance 
incoming requests over multiple services (targets). So for example an upstream
named `service.v1.xyz` with an API object created with an `upstream_url=https://service.v1.xyz/some/path`.
Requests for this API would be proxied to the targets defined within the upstream.

An upstream also includes a [health checker][healthchecks], which is able to
enable and disable targets based on their ability or inability to serve
requests. The configuration for the health checker is stored in the upstream
object, and applies to all of its targets.

```json
{
    "name": "service.v1.xyz",
    "hash_on": "none",
    "hash_fallback": "none",

### Update Or create Upstream

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint put">/upstreams/</div>

#### Request Body

{{ page.upstream_body }}

The behavior of `PUT` endpoints is the following: if the request payload **does
not** contain an entity's primary key (`id` for Upstreams), the entity will be
created with the given payload. If the request payload **does** contain an
entity's primary key, the payload will "replace" the entity specified by the
given primary key. If the primary key is **not** that of an existing entity, `404
NOT FOUND` will be returned.

#### Response

```
HTTP 201 Created or HTTP 200 OK
```

See POST and PATCH responses.

---

### Delete upstream

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint delete">/upstreams/{name or id}</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream to delete

#### Response

```
HTTP 204 No Content
```

---

## Target Object

A target is an ip address/hostname with a port that identifies an instance of a backend
service. Every upstream can have many targets, and the targets can be 
dynamically added. Changes are effectuated on the fly.

Because the upstream maintains a history of target changes, the targets cannot
be deleted or modified. To disable a target, post a new one with `weight=0`;
alternatively, use the `DELETE` convenience method to accomplish the same.

The current target object definition is the one with the latest `created_at`.

```json
{
    "target": "1.2.3.4:80",
    "weight": 15,
    "upstream_id": "ee3310c1-6789-40ac-9386-f79c0cb58432"
}
```

---

### Add target

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint post">/upstreams/{name or id}/targets</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream to which to add the target

#### Request Body

{{ page.target_body }}

#### Response

```
HTTP 201 Created
```

```json
{
    "id": "4661f55e-95c2-4011-8fd6-c5c56df1c9db",
    "target": "1.2.3.4:80",
    "weight": 15,
    "upstream_id": "ee3310c1-6789-40ac-9386-f79c0cb58432",
    "created_at": 1485523507446
}
```

---

### List targets

Lists all targets currently active on the upstream's load balancing wheel.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> The behavior of this endpoint changed in the 0.12.0
  release from returning all targets belonging to an upstream, to only
  currently active ones. The endpoint returning the entire history of targets
  was moved to [List all targets](#list-all-targets).
</div>

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint get">/upstreams/{name or id}/targets</div>

### List all targets

Lists all targets of the upstream. Multiple target objects for the same
target may be returned, showing the history of changes for a specific target.
The target object with the latest `created_at` is the current definition.

### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint get">/upstreams/{name or id}/targets/all/</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream for which to list the targets.

#### Response

### Delete target

Disable a target in the load balancer. Under the hood, this method creates
a new entry for the given target definition with a `weight` of 0.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This endpoint is only available with Kong 0.10.1+
</div>

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint delete">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{target or id}</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream for which to delete the target.
`target or id`<br>**required** | The host/port combination element of the target to remove, or the `id` of an existing target entry.

#### Response

```
HTTP 204 No Content
```

### Set target as healthy

Set the current health status of a target in the load balancer to "healthy"
in the entire Kong cluster.

This endpoint can be used to manually re-enable a target that was previously
disabled by the upstream's [health checker][healthchecks]. Upstreams only
forward requests to healthy nodes, so this call tells Kong to start using this
target again.

This resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all workers
of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the "healthy"
status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint post">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{target or id}/healthy</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream.
`target or id`<br>**required** | The host/port combination element of the target to set as healthy, or the `id` of an existing target entry.

#### Response

```
HTTP 204 No Content
```

---

### Set target as unhealthy

Set the current health status of a target in the load balancer to "unhealthy"
in the entire Kong cluster.

This endpoint can be used to manually disable a target and have it stop
responding to requests. Upstreams only forward requests to healthy nodes, so
this call tells Kong to start skipping this target in the ring-balancer
algorithm.

This call resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all
workers of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the
"unhealthy" status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.

[Active health checks][active] continue to execute for unhealthy
targets. Note that if active health checks are enabled and the probe detects
that the target is actually healthy, it will automatically re-enable it again.
To permanently remove a target from the ring-balancer, you should [delete a
target](#delete-target) instead.

#### Endpoint

<div class="endpoint post">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{target or id}/healthy</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream.
`target or id`<br>**required** | The host/port combination element of the target to set as unhealthy, or the `id` of an existing target entry.

#### Response

```
HTTP 204 No Content
