# Enabling Plugins

In this section, you'll learn how to configure Kong plugins. One of the core
principles of Kong is its extensibility through [plugins][plugins]. Plugins
allow you to easily add new features to your API or make your API easier to
manage.

In the steps below you will configure the [key-auth][key-auth] plugin to add
authentication to your Service. Prior to the addition of this plugin, **all**
requests to your Service would be proxied upstream. Once you add and configure this
plugin, **only** requests with the correct API key(s) will be proxied - all
other requests will be rejected by Kong, thus protecting your upstream service
from unauthorized use.


1. ### Configure the key-auth plugin for the Service you <a href="/docs/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/getting-started/configuring-a-service">configured in Kong</a>.

    Issue the following cURL request:

    ```bash
    $ curl -i -X POST \
      --url http://localhost:8001/services/example-service/plugins/ \
      --data 'name=key-auth'
    ```

    Or, add your first plugin via the Admin GUI:
    
    <video width="100%" autoplay loop controls>
     <source src="https://konghq.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/0_32_create_plugin.mp4" type="video/mp4">
     Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>

    **Note:** This plugin also accepts a `config.key_names` parameter, which
    defaults to `['apikey']`. It is a list of headers and parameters names (both
    are supported) that are supposed to contain the key during a request.

2. ### Verify that the plugin is properly configured

    Issue the following cURL request to verify that the [key-auth][key-auth]
    plugin was properly configured on the Service:

    ```bash
    $ curl -i -X GET \
      --url http://localhost:8000/ \
      --header 'Host: example.com'
    ```

    Since you did not specify the required `apikey` header or parameter, the
    response should be `401 Unauthorized`:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    ...

    {
      "message": "No API key found in request"
    }
    ```

### Next Steps

Now that you've configured the **key-auth** plugin let's learn to add
Consumers to your Service so we can continue proxying requests through Kong.

Go to [Adding Consumers &rsaquo;][adding-consumers]

[key-auth]: /plugins/key-authentication
[plugins]: /plugins
[adding-consumers]: /docs/enterprise/{{page.kong_version}}/getting-started/adding-consumers
