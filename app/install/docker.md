Details about how to use Kong in Docker can be found on the DockerHub repository hosting the image: [kong](https://hub.docker.com/_/kong/). We also have a [Docker Compose template](https://github.com/Kong/docker-kong/tree/master/compose) with built-in orchestration and scalability.

## With a Database

Here is a quick example showing how to connect a Kong container to a Cassandra or PostgreSQL container.

1. **Create a Docker network**

    You will need to create a custom network to allow the containers to
    discover and communicate with each other. In this example `kong-net` is the
    network name, you can use any name.

    ```bash
    $ docker network create kong-net
    ```

2. **Start your database**


    If you wish to use a Cassandra container:

    ```bash
    $ docker run -d --name kong-database \
                  --network=kong-net \
                  -p 9042:9042 \
                  cassandra:3
    ```

    If you wish to use a PostgreSQL container:

    ```bash
    $ docker run -d --name kong-database \
                  --network=kong-net \
                  -p 5432:5432 \
                  -e "POSTGRES_USER=kong" \
                  -e "POSTGRES_DB=kong" \
                  postgres:9.6
    ```

3. **Prepare your database**

    Run the migrations with an ephemeral Kong container:

    ```bash
    $ docker run --rm \
        --network=kong-net \
        -e "KONG_DATABASE=postgres" \
        -e "KONG_PG_HOST=kong-database" \
        -e "KONG_CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS=kong-database" \
        kong:latest kong migrations bootstrap
    ```

    In the above example, both Cassandra and PostgreSQL are configured, but you
    should update the `KONG_DATABASE` environment variable with either
    `cassandra` or `postgres`.

    **Note for Kong < 0.15**: with Kong versions below 0.15 (up to 0.14), use
    the `up` sub-command instead of `bootstrap`. Also note that with Kong <
    0.15, migrations should never be run concurrently; only one Kong node
    should be performing migrations at a time. This limitation is lifted for
    Kong 0.15, 1.0, and above.

4. **Start Kong**

    When the migrations have run and your database is ready, start a Kong
    container that will connect to your database container, just like the
    ephemeral migrations container:

    ```bash
    $ docker run -d --name kong \
        --network=kong-net \
        -e "KONG_DATABASE=postgres" \
        -e "KONG_PG_HOST=kong-database" \
        -e "KONG_CASSANDRA_CONTACT_POINTS=kong-database" \
        -e "KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" \
        -e "KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" \
        -e "KONG_PROXY_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" \
        -e "KONG_ADMIN_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" \
        -e "KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8001, 0.0.0.0:8444 ssl" \
        -p 8000:8000 \
        -p 8443:8443 \
        -p 8001:8001 \
        -p 8444:8444 \
        kong:latest
    ```

5. **Use Kong**

    Kong is running:

    ```bash
    $ curl -i http://localhost:8001/
    ```

    Quickly learn how to use Kong with the [5-minute Quickstart](/latest/getting-started/quickstart).

## DB-less mode

The steps involved in starting Kong in [DB-less mode] are the following:

1. **Create a Docker network**

    This is the same as in the Pg/Cassandra guide. We're also using `kong-net` as the
    network name and it can also be changed to something else.

    ```bash
    $ docker network create kong-net
    ```

    This step is not strictly needed for running Kong in DB-less mode, but it is a good
    precaution in case you want to add other things in the future (like a rate-limiting plugin
    backed up by a Redis cluster).

2. **Create a Docker volume**

    For the purposes of this guide, a [Docker Volume] is a folder inside the host machine which
    can be mapped into a folder in the container. Volumes have a name. In this case we're going
    to name ours `kong-vol`

    ```bash
    $ docker volume create kong-vol
    ```

    You should be able to inspect the volume now:

    ```bash
    $ docker volume inspect kong-vol
    ```

    The result should be similar to this:

    ```json
    [
        {
            "CreatedAt": "2019-05-28T12:40:09Z",
            "Driver": "local",
            "Labels": {},
            "Mountpoint": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/kong-vol/_data",
            "Name": "kong-vol",
            "Options": {},
            "Scope": "local"
        }
    ]
    ```

    Notice the `MountPoint` entry. We will need that path in the next step.

3. **Prepare your declarative configuration file**

    The syntax and properties are described on the [Declarative Configuration Format] guide.

    Add whatever core entities (Services, Routes, Plugins, Consumers, etc) you need there.

    On this guide we'll assume you named it `kong.yml`.

    Save it inside the `MountPoint` path mentioned in the previous step. In the case of this
    guide, that would be `/var/lib/docker/volumes/kong-vol/_data/kong.yml`


4. **Start Kong in DB-less mode**

   Although it's possible to start the Kong container with just `KONG_DATABASE=off`, it is usually
   desirable to also include the declarative configuration file as a parameter via the
   `KONG_DECLARATIVE_CONFIG` variable name. In order to do this, we need to make the file
   "visible" from within the container. We achieve this with the `-v` flag, which maps
   the `kong-vol` volume to the `/usr/local/kong/declarative` folder in the container.

    ```bash
    $ docker run -d --name kong \
        --network=kong-net \
        -v "kong-vol:/usr/local/kong/declarative" \
        -e "KONG_DATABASE=off" \
        -e "KONG_DECLARATIVE_CONFIG=/usr/local/kong/declarative/kong.yml" \
        -e "KONG_PROXY_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" \
        -e "KONG_ADMIN_ACCESS_LOG=/dev/stdout" \
        -e "KONG_PROXY_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" \
        -e "KONG_ADMIN_ERROR_LOG=/dev/stderr" \
        -e "KONG_ADMIN_LISTEN=0.0.0.0:8001, 0.0.0.0:8444 ssl" \
        -p 8000:8000 \
        -p 8443:8443 \
        -p 8001:8001 \
        -p 8444:8444 \
        kong:latest
    ```

4. **Use Kong**

    Kong should be running and it should contain some of the entities added in kong.yml:

    ```bash
    $ curl -i http://localhost:8001/
    ```

    For example, get a list of services:

    ```bash
    $ curl -i http://localhost:8001/services
    ```
