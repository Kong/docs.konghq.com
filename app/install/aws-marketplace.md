----

### Notes

1. **Cassandra**

    The Kong AWS Marketplace AMI image is designed for simplicity and fast deployment, this means it comes bundled with [Cassandra](/about/faq/#how-does-it-work) on the same image.

    **Note**: *For optimal performance, we recommend deploying a Cassandra cluster separately from the Kong Cluster.*

    Please refer to the [AWS Cloud Formation Template](/install/aws-cloudformation) for custom deployment of Cassandra and Kong Clusters on AWS.

2. **Scaling**

    Each EC2 Node is self-contained, running both Kong & Cassandra. In order to add more nodes and start a cluster, you'll have have to turn on [Clustering in Cassandra](/about/faq/#apache-cassandra), and modify each node's [`kong.yml`](https://docs.konghq.com/0.5.x/configuration/#databases_available) with the updated Cassandra information.

3. **Use Kong**
