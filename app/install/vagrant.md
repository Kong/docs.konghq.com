Vagrant can be used to create an isolated environment for Kong and its
dependencies.

You can use the Vagrant box either as an all-in-one Kong installation for
testing purposes, or you can link it up with source code and start developing
on Kong or on custom plugins.

Here is a quick example showing how to build a (disposable) test setup:

1. **Get the Vagrantfile and start the VM**

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/Kong/kong-vagrant
    $ cd kong-vagrant/
    $ vagrant up
    ```

2. **Start Kong**

    ```bash
    # specify migrations flag to initialise the datastore
    $ vagrant ssh -c "kong start --run-migrations"
    ```

    The host ports `8000`, `8001`, `8443`, and `8444` will be forwarded to the Vagrant box.

3. **Use Kong**

    Kong is running:

    ```bash
    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:8001
    ```
