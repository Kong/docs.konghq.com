There currently are two options for installing Kong from the Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) Marketplace - you can deploy Kong virtual machines with Cassandra
on Google Compute Engine(GCE), or you can deploy Kong on Google Kubernetes
Engine (GKE) with Postgres.

Note that GCP's [Free Tier and credit](https://cloud.google.com/free/),
make it likely that you can experiment with Kong on GCP for free!
