plugin_body: |
    Attributes | Description
    ---:| ---
    `name` |  The name of the Plugin that's going to be added. Currently the Plugin must be installed in every Kong instance separately. 
    `route`<br>*optional* |  If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via the specified route. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Route being used.  Defaults to `null`. With form-encoded, the notation is `route.id=<route_id>`. With JSON, use `"route":{"id":"<route_id>"}`.
    `service`<br>*optional* |  If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via one of the routes belonging to the specified Service. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Service being matched.  Defaults to `null`. With form-encoded, the notation is `service.id=<service_id>`. With JSON, use `"service":{"id":"<service_id>"}`.
    `consumer`<br>*optional* |  If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers this way.). Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated consumer.  Defaults to `null`. With form-encoded, the notation is `consumer.id=<consumer_id>`. With JSON, use `"consumer":{"id":"<consumer_id>"}`.
    `config`<br>*optional* |  The configuration properties for the Plugin which can be found on the plugins documentation page in the [Kong Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/). 
    `run_on` |  Control on which Kong nodes this plugin will run, given a Service Mesh scenario. Accepted values are: * `first`, meaning "run on the first Kong node that is encountered by the request". On an API Getaway scenario, this is the usual operation, since there is only one Kong node in between source and destination. In a sidecar-to-sidecar Service Mesh scenario, this means running the plugin only on the Kong sidecar of the outbound connection. * `second`, meaning "run on the second node that is encountered by the request". This option is only relevant for sidecar-to-sidecar Service Mesh scenarios: this means running the plugin only on the Kong sidecar of the inbound connection. * `all` means "run on all nodes", meaning both sidecars in a sidecar-to-sidecar scenario. This is useful for tracing/logging plugins.  Defaults to `"first"`.
    `protocols` |  A list of the request protocols that will trigger this plugin. Possible values are `"http"`, `"https"`, `"tcp"`, and `"tls"`. The default value, as well as the possible values allowed on this field, may change depending on the plugin type. For example, plugins that only work in stream mode will may only support `"tcp"` and `"tls"`.  Defaults to `["http", "https"]`.
    `enabled`<br>*optional* | Whether the plugin is applied. Defaults to `true`.
    `tags`<br>*optional* |  An optional set of strings associated with the Plugin, for grouping and filtering.

sni_body: |
    Attributes | Description
    ---:| ---
    `name` | The SNI name to associate with the given certificate. May contain a single wildcard in the leftmost (suffix) or rightmost (prefix) position. This can be helpful when maintaining multiple subdomains, as a single SNI configured with a wildcard name can be used to match multiple subdomains, instead of creating an SNI entity for each. Valid wildcard positions are `mydomain.*`, `*.mydomain.com`, and `*.www.mydomain.com`. Plain SNI names (no wildcard) take priority when matching, followed by prefix and then suffix.
    `tags`<br>*optional* |  An optional set of strings associated with the SNIs, for grouping and filtering. 
    `certificate` |  The id (a UUID) of the certificate with which to associate the SNI hostname. The Certificate must have a valid private key associated with it to be used by the SNI object.  With form-encoded, the notation is `certificate.id=<certificate_id>`. With JSON, use `"certificate":{"id":"<certificate_id>"}`.

    `healthchecks.passive.unhealthy.timeouts`<br>*optional* | Number of timeouts in proxied traffic to consider a target unhealthy, as observed by passive health checks. Defaults to `0`.
    `healthchecks.passive.type`<br>*optional* | Whether to perform passive health checks interpreting HTTP/HTTPS statuses, or just check for TCP connection success. Possible values are `tcp`, `http` or `https` (in passive checks, `http` and `https` options are equivalent.). Defaults to `"http"`.
    `healthchecks.passive.healthy.successes`<br>*optional* | Number of successes in proxied traffic (as defined by `healthchecks.passive.healthy.http_statuses`) to consider a target healthy, as observed by passive health checks. Defaults to `0`.
    `healthchecks.passive.healthy.http_statuses`<br>*optional* | An array of HTTP statuses which represent healthiness when produced by proxied traffic, as observed by passive health checks. Defaults to `[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 226, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]`. With form-encoded, the notation is `http_statuses[]=200&http_statuses[]=201`. With JSON, use an Array.
    `tags`<br>*optional* |  An optional set of strings associated with the Upstream, for grouping and filtering.

<div class="alert alert-info.blue" role="alert">
  This page refers to the Admin API for running Kong configured with a
  database (Postgres or Cassandra). For using the Admin API for Kong
  in DB-less mode, please refer to the
  <a href="/{{page.kong_version}}/db-less-admin-api">Admin API for DB-less Mode</a>
  page.
</div>

Kong comes with an **internal** RESTful Admin API for administration purposes.
Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will
keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

- `8001` is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
- `8444` is the default port for HTTPS traffic to the Admin API.

This API is designed for internal use and provides full control over Kong, so
care should be taken when setting up Kong environments to avoid undue public
exposure of this API. See [this document][secure-admin-api] for a discussion
of methods to secure the Admin API.

## Supported Content Types

The Admin API accepts 2 content types on every endpoint:

- **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**

Simple enough for basic request bodies, you will probably use it most of the time.
Note that when sending nested values, Kong expects nested objects to be referenced
with dotted keys. Example:

```
config.limit=10&config.period=seconds
```

Arrays and sets can be specified in various ways:

1. Sending same parameter multiple times:
    ```
    hosts=example.com&hosts=example.org
    ```
2. Using array notation:
    ```
    hosts[1]=example.com&hosts[2]=example.org
    ```
    or 
    ```
    hosts[]=example.com&hosts[]=example.org
    ```
    Array and object notation can also be mixed:

    ```
    config.hosts[1]=example.com&config.hosts[2]=example.org
    ```


- **application/json**

Handy for complex bodies (ex: complex plugin configuration), in that case simply send
a JSON representation of the data you want to send. Example:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "limit": 10,
        "period": "seconds"
    }
}
```

JSON arrays can be specified as well:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "limit": 10,
        "period": "seconds",
        "hosts": [ "example.com", "example.org" ]
    }
}
```

## Information Routes



### Retrieve Node Information

Retrieve generic details about a node.

<div class="endpoint get">/</div>

*Response*

```
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "hostname": "",
    "node_id": "6a72192c-a3a1-4c8d-95c6-efabae9fb969",
    "lua_version": "LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3",
    "plugins": {
        "available_on_server": [
            ...
        ],
        "enabled_in_cluster": [
            ...
        ]
    },
    "configuration" : {
        ...
    },
    "tagline": "Welcome to Kong",
    "version": "0.14.0"
}
```

* `node_id`: A UUID representing the running Kong node. This UUID
  is randomly generated when Kong starts, so the node will have a
  different `node_id` each time it is restarted.
* `available_on_server`: Names of plugins that are installed on the node.
* `enabled_in_cluster`: Names of plugins that are enabled/configured.
  That is, the plugins configurations currently in the datastore shared
  by all Kong nodes.


---

### Retrieve Node Status

Retrieve usage information about a node, with some basic information
about the connections being processed by the underlying nginx process,
the status of the database connection, and node's memory usage.

If you want to monitor the Kong process, since Kong is built on top
of nginx, every existing nginx monitoring tool or agent can be used.


<div class="endpoint get">/status</div>

*Response*

```
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "database": {
      "reachable": true
    },
    "memory": {
        "workers_lua_vms": [{
            "http_allocated_gc": "0.02 MiB",
            "pid": 18477
          }, {
            "http_allocated_gc": "0.02 MiB",
            "pid": 18478
        }],
        "lua_shared_dicts": {
            "kong": {
                "allocated_slabs": "0.04 MiB",
                "capacity": "5.00 MiB"
            },
            "kong_db_cache": {
                "allocated_slabs": "0.80 MiB",
                "capacity": "128.00 MiB"
            },
        }
    },
    "server": {
        "total_requests": 3,
        "connections_active": 1,
        "connections_accepted": 1,
        "connections_handled": 1,
        "connections_reading": 0,
        "connections_writing": 1,
        "connections_waiting": 0
    }
}
```

* `memory`: Metrics about the memory usage.
    * `workers_lua_vms`: An array with all workers of the Kong node, where each
      entry contains:
    * `http_allocated_gc`: HTTP submodule's Lua virtual machine's memory
      usage information, as reported by `collectgarbage("count")`, for every
      active worker, i.e. a worker that received a proxy call in the last 10
      seconds.
    * `pid`: worker's process identification number.
    * `lua_shared_dicts`: An array of information about dictionaries that are
      shared with all workers in a Kong node, where each array node contains how
      much memory is dedicated for the specific shared dictionary (`capacity`)
      and how much of said memory is in use (`allocated_slabs`).
      These shared dictionaries have least recent used (LRU) eviction
      capabilities, so a full dictionary, where `allocated_slabs == capacity`,
      will work properly. However for some dictionaries, e.g. cache HIT/MISS
      shared dictionaries, increasing their size can be beneficial for the
      overall performance of a Kong node.
  * The memory usage unit and precision can be changed using the querystring
    arguments `unit` and `scale`:
      * `unit`: one of `b/B`, `k/K`, `m/M`, `g/G`, which will return results
        in bytes, kibibytes, mebibytes, or gibibytes, respectively. When
        "bytes" are requested, the memory values in the response will have a
        number type instead of string. Defaults to `m`.
      * `scale`: the number of digits to the right of the decimal points when
        values are given in human-readable memory strings (unit other than
        "bytes"). Defaults to `2`.
      You can get the shared dictionaries memory usage in kibibytes with 4
      digits of precision by doing: `GET /status?unit=k&scale=4`
* `server`: Metrics about the nginx HTTP/S server.
    * `total_requests`: The total number of client requests.
    * `connections_active`: The current number of active client
      connections including Waiting connections.
    * `connections_accepted`: The total number of accepted client
      connections.
    * `connections_handled`: The total number of handled connections.
      Generally, the parameter value is the same as accepts unless
      some resource limits have been reached.
    * `connections_reading`: The current number of connections
      where Kong is reading the request header.
    * `connections_writing`: The current number of connections
      where nginx is writing the response back to the client.
    * `connections_waiting`: The current number of idle client
      connections waiting for a request.
* `database`: Metrics about the database.
    * `reachable`: A boolean value reflecting the state of the
      database connection. Please note that this flag **does not**
      reflect the health of the database itself.


---

## Tags

Tags are strings associated to entities in Kong. Each tag must be composed of one or more
alphanumeric characters, `_`, `-`, `.` or `~`.

Most core entities can be *tagged* via their `tags` attribute, upon creation or edition.

Tags can be used to filter core entities as well, via the `?tags` querystring parameter.

For example: if you normally get a list of all the Services by doing:

```
GET /services
```

You can get the list of all the Services tagged `example` by doing:

```
GET /services?tags=example
```

Similarly, if you want to filter Services so that you only get the ones tagged `example` *and*
`admin`, you can do that like so:

```
GET /services?tags=example,admin
```

Finally, if you wanted to filter the Services tagged `example` *or* `admin`, you could use:

```
GET /services?tags=example/admin
```

Some notes:

* A maximum of 5 tags can be queried simultaneously in a single request with `,` or `/`
* Mixing operators is not supported: if you try to mix `,` with `/` in the same querystring,
  you will receive an error.
* You may need to quote and/or escape some characters when using them from the
  command line.
* Filtering by `tags` is not supported in foreign key relationship endpoints. For example,
  the `tags` parameter will be ignored in a request such as `GET /services/foo/routes?tags=a,b`
* `offset` parameters are not guaranteed to work if the `tags` parameter is altered or removed


### List All Tags

Returns a paginated list of all the tags in the system.

The list of entities will not be restricted to a single entity type: all the
entities tagged with tags will be present on this list.

If an entity is tagged with more than one tag, the `entity_id` for that entity
will appear more than once in the resulting list. Similarly, if several entities
have been tagged with the same tag, the tag will appear in several items of this list.

## Service Object

Service entities, as the name implies, are abstractions of each of your own
upstream services. Examples of Services would be a data transformation
microservice, a billing API, etc.

The main attribute of a Service is its URL (where Kong should proxy traffic
to), which can be set as a single string or by specifying its `protocol`,
`host`, `port` and `path` individually.

Services are associated to Routes (a Service can have many Routes associated
with it). Routes are entry-points in Kong and define rules to match client
requests. Once a Route is matched, Kong proxies the request to its associated
Service. See the [Proxy Reference][proxy-reference] for a detailed explanation
of how Kong proxies traffic.

Services can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

## Route Object

Route entities define rules to match client requests. Each Route is
associated with a Service, and a Service may have multiple Routes associated to
it. Every request matching a given Route will be proxied to its associated
Service.

The combination of Routes and Services (and the separation of concerns between
them) offers a powerful routing mechanism with which it is possible to define
fine-grained entry-points in Kong leading to different upstream services of
your infrastructure.

Routes can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

## Plugin Object

A Plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed during
the HTTP request/response lifecycle. It is how you can add functionalities
to Services that run behind Kong, like Authentication or Rate Limiting for
example. You can find more information about how to install and what values
each plugin takes by visiting the [Kong Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/).

When adding a Plugin Configuration to a Service, every request made by a client to
that Service will run said Plugin. If a Plugin needs to be tuned to different
values for some specific Consumers, you can do so by creating a separate
plugin instance that specifies both the Service and the Consumer, through the
`service` and `consumer` fields.

Plugins can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).


```json
{{ page.plugin_json }}
```

See the [Precedence](#precedence) section below for more details.

#### Precedence

A plugin will always be run once and only once per request. But the
configuration with which it will run depends on the entities it has been
configured for.

Plugins can be configured for various entities, combination of entities, or
even globally. This is useful, for example, when you wish to configure a plugin
a certain way for most requests, but make _authenticated requests_ behave
slightly differently.

Therefore, there exists an order of precedence for running a plugin when it has
been applied to different entities with different configurations. The rule of
thumb is: the more specific a plugin is with regards to how many entities it
has been configured on, the higher its priority.

The complete order of precedence when a plugin has been configured multiple
times is:

1. Plugins configured on a combination of: a Route, a Service, and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
2. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
3. Plugins configured on a combination of a Service and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
4. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Service.
5. Plugins configured on a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
6. Plugins configured on a Route.
7. Plugins configured on a Service.
8. Plugins configured to run globally.

**Example**: if the `rate-limiting` plugin is applied twice (with different
configurations): for a Service (Plugin config A), and for a Consumer (Plugin
config B), then requests authenticating this Consumer will run Plugin config B
and ignore A. However, requests that do not authenticate this Consumer will
fallback to running Plugin config A. Note that if config B is disabled
(its `enabled` flag is set to `false`), config A will apply to requests that
would have otherwise matched config B.

## SNI Object

An SNI object represents a many-to-one mapping of hostnames to a certificate.
That is, a certificate object can have many hostnames associated with it; when
Kong receives an SSL request, it uses the SNI field in the Client Hello to
lookup the certificate object based on the SNI associated with the certificate.

SNIs can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

## Upstream Object

The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to loadbalance
incoming requests over multiple services (targets). So for example an upstream
named `service.v1.xyz` for a Service object whose `host` is `service.v1.xyz`.
Requests for this Service would be proxied to the targets defined within the upstream.

An upstream also includes a [health checker][healthchecks], which is able to
enable and disable targets based on their ability or inability to serve
requests. The configuration for the health checker is stored in the upstream
object, and applies to all of its targets.

Upstreams can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

### Show Upstream Health for Node

Displays the health status for all Targets of a given Upstream, according to
the perspective of a specific Kong node. Note that, being node-specific
information, making this same request to different nodes of the Kong cluster
may produce different results. For example, one specific node of the Kong
cluster may be experiencing network issues, causing it to fail to connect to
some Targets: these Targets will be marked as unhealthy by that node
(directing traffic from this node to other Targets that it can successfully
reach), but healthy to all others Kong nodes (which have no problems using that
Target).

The `data` field of the response contains an array of Target objects.
The health for each Target is returned in its `health` field:

* If a Target fails to be activated in the ring balancer due to DNS issues,
  its status displays as `DNS_ERROR`.
* When [health checks][healthchecks] are not enabled in the Upstream
  configuration, the health status for active Targets is displayed as
  `HEALTHCHECKS_OFF`.
* When health checks are enabled and the Target is determined to be healthy,
  either automatically or [manually](#set-target-as-healthy),
  its status is displayed as `HEALTHY`. This means that this Target is
  currently included in this Upstream's load balancer ring.
* When a Target has been disabled by either active or passive health checks
  (circuit breakers) or [manually](#set-target-as-unhealthy),
  its status is displayed as `UNHEALTHY`. The load balancer is not directing
  any traffic to this Target via this Upstream.


<div class="endpoint get">/upstreams/{name or id}/health/</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the Upstream for which to display Target health.

## Target Object

A target is an ip address/hostname with a port that identifies an instance of a backend
service. Every upstream can have many targets, and the targets can be
dynamically added. Changes are effectuated on the fly.

Because the upstream maintains a history of target changes, the targets cannot
be deleted or modified. To disable a target, post a new one with `weight=0`;
alternatively, use the `DELETE` convenience method to accomplish the same.

The current target object definition is the one with the latest `created_at`.

Targets can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).


```json
{{ page.target_json }}
```

### Add Target

##### Create Target Associated to a Specific Upstream

<div class="endpoint post">/upstreams/{upstream host:port or id}/targets</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream host:port or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier or the `host:port` attribute of the Upstream that should be associated to the newly-created Target.


*Request Body*

{{ page.target_body }}


*Response*

```
HTTP 201 Created
```

```json
{{ page.target_json }}
```

### List Targets

##### List Targets Associated to a Specific Upstream

<div class="endpoint get">/upstreams/{upstream host:port or id}/targets</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream host:port or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier or the `host:port` attribute of the Upstream whose Targets are to be retrieved. When using this endpoint, only Targets associated to the specified Upstream will be listed.


*Response*

```
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
{{ page.target_data }}
    "next": "http://localhost:8001/targets?offset=6378122c-a0a1-438d-a5c6-efabae9fb969"
}
```


---

### Delete Target

Disable a target in the load balancer. Under the hood, this method creates
a new entry for the given target definition with a `weight` of 0.


<div class="endpoint delete">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{host:port or id}</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream for which to delete the target.
`host:port or id`<br>**required** | The host:port combination element of the target to remove, or the `id` of an existing target entry.


*Response*

```
HTTP 204 No Content
```


---

### Set Target As Healthy

Set the current health status of a target in the load balancer to "healthy"
in the entire Kong cluster.

This endpoint can be used to manually re-enable a target that was previously
disabled by the upstream's [health checker][healthchecks]. Upstreams only
forward requests to healthy nodes, so this call tells Kong to start using this
target again.

This resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all workers
of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the "healthy"
status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.


<div class="endpoint post">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{target or id}/healthy</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream.
`target or id`<br>**required** | The host/port combination element of the target to set as healthy, or the `id` of an existing target entry.


*Response*

```
HTTP 204 No Content
```


---

### Set Target As Unhealthy

Set the current health status of a target in the load balancer to "unhealthy"
in the entire Kong cluster.

This endpoint can be used to manually disable a target and have it stop
responding to requests. Upstreams only forward requests to healthy nodes, so
this call tells Kong to start skipping this target in the ring-balancer
algorithm.

This call resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all
workers of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the
"unhealthy" status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.

[Active health checks][active] continue to execute for unhealthy
targets. Note that if active health checks are enabled and the probe detects
that the target is actually healthy, it will automatically re-enable it again.
To permanently remove a target from the ring-balancer, you should [delete a
target](#delete-target) instead.


<div class="endpoint post">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{target or id}/unhealthy</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream.
`target or id`<br>**required** | The host/port combination element of the target to set as unhealthy, or the `id` of an existing target entry.


*Response*

```
HTTP 204 No Content
```


---

### List All Targets
