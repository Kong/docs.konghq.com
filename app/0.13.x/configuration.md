title: Configuration Reference
---

## Configuration loading

Kong comes with a default configuration file that can be found at
`/etc/kong/kong.conf.default` if you installed Kong via one of the official
packages. To start configuring Kong, you can copy this file:

```bash
$ cp /etc/kong/kong.conf.default /etc/kong/kong.conf
```

Kong will operate with default settings should all the values in your
configuration be commented-out. Upon starting, Kong looks for several
default locations that might contain a configuration file:

```
/etc/kong/kong.conf
/etc/kong.conf
```

You can override this behavior by specifying a custom path for your
configuration file using the `-c / --conf` argument in the CLI:

```bash
$ kong start --conf /path/to/kong.conf
```

The configuration format is straightforward: simply uncomment any property
(comments are defined by the `#` character) and modify it to your needs.
Booleans values can be specified as `on/off` or `true`/`false` for convenience.

## Verifying your configuration

You can verify the integrity of your settings with the `check` command:

```bash
$ kong check <path/to/kong.conf>
configuration at <path/to/kong.conf> is valid
```

This command will take into account the environment variables you have
currently set, and will error out in case your settings are invalid.

Additionally, you can also use the CLI in debug mode to have more insight
as to what properties Kong is being started with:

```bash
$ kong start -c <kong.conf> --vv
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [verbose] no config file found at /etc/kong.conf
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [verbose] no config file found at /etc/kong/kong.conf
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] admin_listen = "0.0.0.0:8001"
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] database = "postgres"
2016/08/11 14:53:36 [debug] log_level = "notice"
[...]
```

## Environment variables

When loading properties out of a configuration file, Kong will also look for
environment variables of the same name. This allows you to fully configure Kong
via environment variables, which is very convenient for container-based
infrastructures, for example.

All environment variables prefixed with `KONG_`, capitalized and bearing the
same name as a setting will override it.

Example:

```
log_level = debug # in kong.conf
```

Can be overridden with:

```bash
$ export KONG_LOG_LEVEL=error
```

## Custom Nginx configuration & embedding Kong

Tweaking the Nginx configuration is an essential part of setting up your Kong
instances since it allows you to optimize its performance for your
infrastructure, or embed Kong in an already running OpenResty instance.

### Custom Nginx configuration

Kong can be started, reloaded and restarted with an `--nginx-conf` argument,
which must specify an Nginx configuration template. Such a template uses the
[Penlight][Penlight] [templating engine][pl.template], which is compiled using
the given Kong configuration, before being dumped in your Kong prefix
directory, moments before starting Nginx.

The default template can be found at:
https://github.com/Kong/kong/tree/master/kong/templates. It is split in two
Nginx configuration files: `nginx.lua` and `nginx_kong.lua`. The former is
minimalistic and includes the latter, which contains everything Kong requires
to run. When `kong start` runs, right before starting Nginx, it copies these
two files into the prefix directory, which looks like so:

```
/usr/local/kong
├── nginx-kong.conf
├── nginx.conf
```

If you wish to include other `server` blocks in your Nginx configuration, or if
you must tweak global settings that are not exposed by the Kong configuration,
here is a suggestion:

```
# ---------------------
# custom_nginx.template
# ---------------------

worker_processes ${{ "{{NGINX_WORKER_PROCESSES" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf
daemon ${{ "{{NGINX_DAEMON" }}}};                     # can be set by kong.conf

pid pids/nginx.pid;                      # this setting is mandatory
error_log logs/error.log ${{ "{{LOG_LEVEL" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf

events {
    use epoll; # custom setting
    multi_accept on;
}

http {
    # include default Kong Nginx config
    include 'nginx-kong.conf';

    # custom server
    server {
        listen 8888;
        server_name custom_server;

        location / {
          ... # etc
        }
    }
}
```

You can then start Kong with:

```bash
$ kong start -c kong.conf --nginx-conf custom_nginx.template
```

If you wish to customize the Kong Nginx sub-configuration file to, eventually,
add other Lua handlers or customize the `lua_*` directives, you can inline the
`nginx_kong.lua` configuration in this `custom_nginx.template` example file:

```
# ---------------------
# custom_nginx.template
# ---------------------

worker_processes ${{ "{{NGINX_WORKER_PROCESSES" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf
daemon ${{ "{{NGINX_DAEMON" }}}};                     # can be set by kong.conf

pid pids/nginx.pid;                      # this setting is mandatory
error_log logs/error.log ${{ "{{LOG_LEVEL" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf

events {}

http {
  resolver ${{ "{{DNS_RESOLVER" }}}} ipv6=off;
  charset UTF-8;
  error_log logs/error.log ${{ "{{LOG_LEVEL" }}}};
  access_log logs/access.log;

  ... # etc
}
```

### Embedding Kong in OpenResty

If you are running your own OpenResty servers, you can also easily embed Kong
by including the Kong Nginx sub-configuration using the `include` directive
(similar to the examples of the previous section). If you have a valid
top-level NGINX configuration that simply includes the Kong-specific
configuration:

```
# my_nginx.conf

http {
    include 'nginx-kong.conf';
}
```

you can start your instance like so:

```bash
$ nginx -p /usr/local/openresty -c my_nginx.conf
```

And Kong will be running in that instance (as configured in `nginx-kong.conf`).

### Serving both a website and your APIs from Kong

A common use case for API providers is to make Kong serve both a website
and the APIs themselves over the Proxy port &mdash; `80` or `443` in
production. For example, `https://my-api.com` (Website) and
`https://my-api.com/api/v1` (API).

To achieve this, we cannot simply declare a new virtual server block,
like we did in the previous section. A good solution is to use a custom
Nginx configuration template which inlines `nginx_kong.lua` and adds a new
`location` block serving the website alongside the Kong Proxy `location`
block:

```
# ---------------------
# custom_nginx.template
# ---------------------

worker_processes ${{ "{{NGINX_WORKER_PROCESSES" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf
daemon ${{ "{{NGINX_DAEMON" }}}};                     # can be set by kong.conf

pid pids/nginx.pid;                      # this setting is mandatory
error_log logs/error.log ${{ "{{LOG_LEVEL" }}}}; # can be set by kong.conf
events {}

http {
  # here, we inline the contents of nginx_kong.lua
  charset UTF-8;

  # any contents until Kong's Proxy server block
  ...

  # Kong's Proxy server block
  server {
    server_name kong;

    # any contents until the location / block
    ...

    # here, we declare our custom location serving our website
    # (or API portal) which we can optimize for serving static assets
    location / {
      root /var/www/my-api.com;
      index index.htm index.html;
      ...
    }

    # Kong's Proxy location / has been changed to /api/v1
    location /api/v1 {
      set $upstream_host nil;
      set $upstream_scheme nil;
      set $upstream_uri nil;

      # Any remaining configuration for the Proxy location
      ...
    }
  }

  # Kong's Admin server block goes below
}
```

logging Admin API requests. If this value is a relative path, it will be placed
under the `prefix` location.

Default: `logs/admin_access.log`

---

#### admin_error_log

Path for Admin API request error logs. Granularity of these logs is adjusted by
the `log_level` directive.

Default: `on`

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

### Nginx section

#### proxy_listen

Comma-separated list of addresses and ports on which the proxy server should
listen. The proxy server is the public entrypoint of Kong, which proxies
traffic from your consumers to your backend services. This value accepts IPv4,
IPv6, and hostnames.

Some suffixes can be specified for each pair:

- `ssl` will require that all connections made through a particular
  address/port be made with TLS enabled.
- `http2` will allow for clients to open HTTP/2 connections to Kong's proxy
  server.
- Finally, `proxy_protocol` will enable usage of the PROXY protocol for a
  given address/port.

the proxy port for this node, enabling a 'control-plane' mode (without traffic
proxying capabilities) which can configure a cluster of nodes connected to the
same database.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#listen for
a description of the accepted formats for this and other `*_listen` values.

Default: `0.0.0.0:8000, 0.0.0.0:8443 ssl`

Example: `0.0.0.0:80, 0.0.0.0:81 http2, 0.0.0.0:443 ssl, 0.0.0.0:444 http2 ssl`

---

#### admin_listen

Comma-separated list of addresses and ports on which the Admin interface
should listen. The Admin interface is the API allowing you to configure and
manage Kong. Access to this interface should be *restricted* to Kong
administrators *only*. This value accepts IPv4, IPv6, and hostnames. Some
suffixes can be specified for each pair:

- `ssl` will require that all connections made through a particular
  address/port be made with TLS enabled.
- `http2` will allow for clients to open HTTP/2 connections to Kong's
  proxy server.
- Finally, `proxy_protocol` will enable usage of the PROXY protocol for a
  given address/port.

This value can be set to `off`, thus disabling the Admin interface for this
node, enabling a 'data-plane' mode (without configuration capabilities)
pulling its configuration changes from the database.

Default: `127.0.0.1:8001, 127.0.0.1:8444 ssl`

Example: `127.0.0.1:8444 http2 ssl`

---

#### nginx_user

Defines user and group credentials used by worker processes. If group is omitted, a
group whose name equals that of user is used.

Default: `nobody nobody`

Example: `nginx www`

---

#### nginx_worker_processes

Determines the number of worker processes spawned by Nginx.
See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#worker_processes for detailed
usage of this directive and a description of accepted values.

Default: `auto`

---

#### nginx_daemon

Determines whether Nginx will run as a daemon or as a foreground process.
Mainly useful for development or when running Kong inside a Docker environment.

See http://nginx.org/en/docs/ngx_core_module.html#daemon.

Default: `on`

---

#### mem_cache_size

Size of the in-memory cache for database entities. The accepted units are `k` and
`m`, with a minimum recommended value of a few MBs.

Default: `128m`

---

#### ssl_cipher_suite

Defines the TLS ciphers served by Nginx. Accepted values are `modern`,
`intermediate`, `old`, or `custom`.
See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS for detailed
descriptions of each cipher suite.

Default: `modern`

---

#### ssl_ciphers

Defines a custom list of TLS ciphers to be served by Nginx. This list must
conform to the pattern defined by `openssl ciphers`. This value is ignored if
`ssl_cipher_suite` is not `custom`.

Default: none

---

#### ssl_cert

The absolute path to the SSL certificate for `proxy_listen` values with SSL enabled.

Default: none

---

#### ssl_cert_key

The absolute path to the SSL key for `proxy_listen` values with SSL enabled.

Default: none

---

#### client_ssl

Determines if Nginx should send client-side SSL certificates when proxying
requests.

Default: `off`

---

#### client_ssl_cert

If `client_ssl` is enabled, the absolute path to the client SSL certificate for
the `proxy_ssl_certificate` directive. Note that this value is statically
defined on the node, and currently cannot be configured on a per-API basis.

Default: none

---

#### client_ssl_cert_key

If `client_ssl` is enabled, the absolute path to the client SSL key for the
`proxy_ssl_certificate_key` address. Note this value is statically defined on
the node, and currently cannot be configured on a per-API basis.

Default: none

---

#### admin_ssl_cert

The absolute path to the SSL certificate for `admin_listen` values with SSL enabled.

Default: none

---

#### admin_ssl_cert_key

The absolute path to the SSL key for `admin_listen` values with SSL enabled.

Default: none

---

#### upstream_keepalive

Sets the maximum number of idle keepalive connections to upstream servers that
are preserved in the cache of each worker process. When this number is
exceeded, the least recently used connections are closed.

Default: `60`

---

#### server_tokens

Enables or disables emitting Kong version on error pages and in the `Server`
or `Via` (in case the request was proxied) response header field.

Default: `on`

---

#### latency_tokens

Enables or disables emitting Kong latency information in the `X-Kong-Proxy-Latency`
and `X-Kong-Upstream-Latency` response header fields.

Default: `on`

---

#### trusted_ips

Defines trusted IP address blocks that are known to send correct
`X-Forwarded-*` headers. Requests from trusted IPs make Kong forward their
`X-Forwarded-*` headers upstream. Non-trusted requests make Kong insert its own
`X-Forwarded-*` headers.

This property also sets the `set_real_ip_from` directive(s) in the Nginx
configuration. It accepts the same type of values (CIDR blocks) but as a
comma-separated list.

To trust *all* /!\ IPs, set this value to `0.0.0.0/0,::/0`.

If the special value `unix:` is specified, all UNIX-domain sockets will be
trusted.

See [the Nginx docs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html#set_real_ip_from)
for more details on the `set_real_ip_from` directive.

Default: none

---

#### real_ip_header

Defines the request header field whose value will be used to replace the client
address. This value sets the [ngx_http_realip_module][ngx_http_realip_module]
directive of the same name in the Nginx configuration.

If this value receives `proxy_protocol`, the `proxy_protocol` parameter will be
appended to the `listen` directive of the Nginx template.

See [the Nginx docs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html#real_ip_header)
for a description of this directive.

Default: `X-Real-IP`

---

#### real_ip_recursive

This value sets the [ngx_http_realip_module][ngx_http_realip_module] directive
of the same name in the Nginx configuration.

See [the Nginx docs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html#real_ip_recursive)
for a description of this directive.

Default: `off`

---

#### client_max_body_size

Defines the maximum request body size allowed by requests proxied by Kong, specified in the
Content-Length request header. If a request exceeds this limit, Kong will respond with a
413 (Request Entity Too Large). Setting this value to 0 disables checking the request body
size.

Note: See [the Nginx docs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_max_body_size)
for further description of this parameter. Numeric values may be suffixed with
`k` or `m` to denote limits in terms of kilobytes or megabytes.

Default: `0`

---

#### client_body_buffer_size

Defines the buffer size for reading the request body. If the client request body is
larger than this value, the body will be buffered to disk. Note that when the body is
buffered to disk Kong plugins that access or manipulate the request body may not work, so
it is advisable to set this value as high as possible (e.g., set it as high as
`client_max_body_size` to force request bodies to be kept in memory). Do note that
high-concurrency environments will require significant memory allocations to process
many concurrent large request bodies.

Note: See [the Nginx docs](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#client_body_buffer_size)
for further description of this parameter. Numeric values may be suffixed with
`k` or `m` to denote limits in terms of kilobytes or megabytes.

Default: `8k`

---

#### error_default_type

Default MIME type to use when the request `Accept` header is missing and Nginx is
returning an error for the request. Accepted values are `text/plain`,
`text/html`, `application/json`, and `application/xml`.

Default: `text/plain`

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

### Datastore section

Kong will store all of its data (such as APIs, Consumers and Plugins) in
either Cassandra or PostgreSQL.

All Kong nodes belonging to the same cluster must connect themselves to the
same database.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <p><strong>Starting with Kong 0.12.0:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>PostgreSQL 9.4 support should be considered deprecated. Users are encouraged to upgrade to 9.5+</li>

### Datastore cache section

In order to avoid unnecessary communication with the datastore, Kong caches
entities (such as APIs, Consumers, Credentials, etc...) for a configurable
period of time. It also handles invalidations if such an entity is updated.

This section allows for configuring the behavior of Kong regarding the
caching of such configuration entities.

---

#### db_update_frequency

Frequency (in seconds) at which to check for
updated entities with the datastore.
When a node creates, updates, or deletes an
entity via the Admin API, other nodes need
to wait for the next poll (configured by
this value) to eventually purge the old
cached entity and start using the new one.

Default: 5 seconds

---

#### db_update_propagation

Time (in seconds) taken for an entity in the
datastore to be propagated to replica nodes
of another datacenter.
When in a distributed environment such as
a multi-datacenter Cassandra cluster, this
value should be the maximum number of
seconds taken by Cassandra to propagate a
row to other datacenters.
When set, this property will increase the
time taken by Kong to propagate the change
of an entity.
Single-datacenter setups or PostgreSQL
servers should suffer no such delays, and
this value can be safely set to 0.

Default: 0 seconds

---

#### db_cache_ttl

Time-to-live (in seconds) of an entity from
the datastore when cached by this node.
Database misses (no entity) are also cached
according to this setting.
If set to 0, such cached entities/misses
never expire.

Default: 3600 seconds (1 hour)

[Back to TOC](#table-of-contents)

---

### DNS resolver section

Kong will resolve hostnames as either `SRV` or `A` records (in that order, and
`CNAME` records will be dereferenced in the process).
In case a name was resolved as an `SRV` record it will also override any given
port number by the `port` field contents received from the DNS server.

The DNS options `SEARCH` and `NDOTS` (from the `/etc/resolv.conf` file) will
be used to expand short names to fully qualified ones. So it will first try the
entire `SEARCH` list for the `SRV` type, if that fails it will try the `SEARCH`
list for `A`, etc.

For the duration of the `ttl`, the internal DNS resolver will loadbalance each
request it gets over the entries in the DNS record. For `SRV` records the
`weight` fields will be honored, but it will only use the lowest `priority`
field entries in the record.

---

#### dns_resolver

Comma separated list of nameservers, each
entry in `ip[:port]` format to be used by
Kong. If not specified the nameservers in
the local `resolv.conf` file will be used.
Port defaults to 53 if omitted. Accepts
both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.

Default: none

---

#### dns_hostsfile

The hosts file to use. This file is read once and its content is static
in memory. To read the file again after modifying it, Kong must be reloaded.

Default: `/etc/hosts`

---

#### dns_order

The order in which to resolve different
record types. The `LAST` type means the
type of the last successful lookup (for the
specified name). The format is a (case
insensitive) comma separated list.

Default: `LAST,SRV,A,CNAME`

---

#### dns_stale_ttl

Defines, in seconds, how long a record will
remain in cache past its TTL. This value
will be used while the new DNS record is
fetched in the background.
Stale data will be used from expiry of a
record until either the refresh query
completes, or the `dns_stale_ttl` number of
seconds have passed.

Default: `4`

---

#### dns_not_found_ttl

TTL in seconds for empty DNS responses and
"(3) name error" responses.

Default: `30`

---

#### dns_error_ttl

TTL in seconds for error responses.

Default: `1`

---

#### dns_no_sync

If enabled, then upon a cache-miss every
request will trigger its own dns query.
When disabled multiple requests for the
same name/type will be synchronised to a
single query.

Default: off

### Development & miscellaneous section

Additional settings inherited from lua-nginx-module allowing for more
flexibility and advanced usage.

See the lua-nginx-module documentation for more information:
https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module

---

#### lua_ssl_trusted_certificate

Absolute path to the certificate authority file for Lua cosockets in PEM
format. This certificate will be the one used for verifying Kong's database
connections, when `pg_ssl_verify` or `cassandra_ssl_verify` are enabled.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_trusted_certificate

Default: none

---

#### lua_ssl_verify_depth

Sets the verification depth in the server certificates chain used by Lua
cosockets, set by `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate`.

This includes the certificates configured for Kong's database connections.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_ssl_verify_depth

Default: `1`

---

#### lua_package_path

Sets the Lua module search path (LUA_PATH). Useful when developing or using
custom plugins not stored in the default search path.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path

Default: none

---

#### lua_package_cpath

Sets the Lua C module search path (LUA_CPATH).

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_cpath

Default: none

---

#### lua_socket_pool_size

Specifies the size limit for every cosocket connection pool associated with
every remote server.

See https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_socket_pool_size

Default: `30`
