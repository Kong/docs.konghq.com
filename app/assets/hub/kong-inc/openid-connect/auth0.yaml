  Authenticate headless service consumers using Auth0's identity provider.

  This configuration uses the `client_credentials` grant, and requires you to have 
  an Auth0 API configured with the `openid` scope. Find your `issuer` URL and `audience`
  in your Auth0 API configuration.

config:
  auth_methods:
    - client_credentials
  issuer: "https://<auth0 API name>.auth0.com/.well-known/openid-configuration"
  audience: "<auth0 API identifier>"

  # Need to re-check this example, it looks incomplete. Does it actually work?
