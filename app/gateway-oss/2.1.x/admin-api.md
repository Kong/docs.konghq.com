    Attributes | Description
    ---:| ---
    `name`<br>*optional* | The Service name.
    `retries`<br>*optional* | The number of retries to execute upon failure to proxy. Default: `5`.
    `protocol` |  The protocol used to communicate with the upstream.  Accepted values are: `"grpc"`, `"grpcs"`, `"http"`, `"https"`, `"tcp"`, `"tls"`.  Default: `"http"`.
    `host` | The host of the upstream server.
    `port` | The upstream server port. Default: `80`.
    `path`<br>*optional* | The path to be used in requests to the upstream server.
    `connect_timeout`<br>*optional* |  The timeout in milliseconds for establishing a connection to the upstream server.  Default: `60000`.
    `write_timeout`<br>*optional* |  The timeout in milliseconds between two successive write operations for transmitting a request to the upstream server.  Default: `60000`.
    `read_timeout`<br>*optional* |  The timeout in milliseconds between two successive read operations for transmitting a request to the upstream server.  Default: `60000`.
    `tags`<br>*optional* |  An optional set of strings associated with the Service for grouping and filtering.
    `client_certificate`<br>*optional* |  Certificate to be used as client certificate while TLS handshaking to the upstream server. With form-encoded, the notation is `client_certificate.id=<client_certificate id>`. With JSON, use "`"client_certificate":{"id":"<client_certificate id>"}`.
    `tls_verify`<br>*optional* |  Whether to enable verification of upstream server TLS certificate. If set to `null`, then the Nginx default is respected.

If set to `null` when Nginx default is respected. If default CA list in Nginx are not specified and TLS verification is enabled, then handshake with upstream server will always fail (because no CA are trusted).  With form-encoded, the notation is `ca_certificates[]=4e3ad2e4-0bc4-4638-8e34-c84a417ba39b&ca_certificates[]=51e77dc2-8f3e-4afa-9d0e-0e3bbbcfd515`. With JSON, use an Array.
    `url`<br>*shorthand-attribute* |  Shorthand attribute to set `protocol`, `host`, `port` and `path` at once. This attribute is write-only (the Admin API never returns the URL).

    Attributes | Description
    ---:| ---
    `name`<br>*optional* | The name of the Route.
    `protocols` |  A list of the protocols this Route should allow. When set to `["https"]`, HTTP requests are answered with a request to upgrade to HTTPS.  Default: `["http", "https"]`.
    `methods`<br>*semi-optional* |  A list of HTTP methods that match this Route.
    `hosts`<br>*semi-optional* |  A list of domain names that match this Route.  With form-encoded, the notation is `hosts[]=example.com&hosts[]=foo.test`. With JSON, use an Array.
    `paths`<br>*semi-optional* |  A list of paths that match this Route.  With form-encoded, the notation is `paths[]=/foo&paths[]=/bar`. With JSON, use an Array.
    `headers`<br>*semi-optional* |  One or more lists of values indexed by header name that will cause this Route to match if present in the request. The `Host` header cannot be used with this attribute: hosts should be specified using the `hosts` attribute.
    `https_redirect_status_code` |  The status code Kong responds with when all properties of a Route match except the protocol i.e. if the protocol of the request is `HTTP` instead of `HTTPS`. `Location` header is injected by Kong if the field is set to 301, 302, 307 or 308.  Accepted values are: `426`, `301`, `302`, `307`, `308`.  Default: `426`.
    `regex_priority`<br>*optional* |  A number used to choose which route resolves a given request when several routes match it using regexes simultaneously. When two routes match the path and have the same `regex_priority`, the older one (lowest `created_at`) is used. Note that the priority for non-regex routes is different (longer non-regex routes are matched before shorter ones).  Default: `0`.
    `strip_path`<br>*optional* |  When matching a Route via one of the `paths`, strip the matching prefix from the upstream request URL.  Default: `true`.
    `path_handling`<br>*optional* |  Controls how the Service path, Route path and requested path are combined when sending a request to the upstream. See above for a detailed description of each behavior.  Accepted values are: `"v0"`, `"v1"`.  Default: `"v0"`.
    `preserve_host`<br>*optional* |  When matching a Route via one of the `hosts` domain names, use the request `Host` header in the upstream request headers. If set to `false`, the upstream `Host` header will be that of the Service's `host`.
    `snis`<br>*semi-optional* |  A list of SNIs that match this Route when using stream routing.
    `sources`<br>*semi-optional* |  A list of IP sources of incoming connections that match this Route when using stream routing. Each entry is an object with fields "ip" (optionally in CIDR range notation) and/or "port".
    `destinations`<br>*semi-optional* |  A list of IP destinations of incoming connections that match this Route when using stream routing. Each entry is an object with fields "ip" (optionally in CIDR range notation) and/or "port".
    `tags`<br>*optional* |  An optional set of strings associated with the Route for grouping and filtering.
    `service`<br>*optional* |  The Service this Route is associated to. This is where the Route proxies traffic to. With form-encoded, the notation is `service.id=<service id>` or `service.name=<service name>`. With JSON, use "`"service":{"id":"<service id>"}` or `"service":{"name":"<service name>"}`.

    Attributes | Description
    ---:| ---
    `name` | This is a hostname, which must be equal to the `host` of a Service.
    `algorithm`<br>*optional* | Which load balancing algorithm to use. Accepted values are: `"consistent-hashing"`, `"least-connections"`, `"round-robin"`.  Default: `"round-robin"`.
    `hash_on`<br>*optional* | What to use as hashing input. Using `none` results in a weighted-round-robin scheme with no hashing. Accepted values are: `"none"`, `"consumer"`, `"ip"`, `"header"`, `"cookie"`.  Default: `"none"`.
    `hash_fallback`<br>*optional* | What to use as hashing input if the primary `hash_on` does not return a hash (eg. header is missing, or no Consumer identified). Not available if `hash_on` is set to `cookie`. Accepted values are: `"none"`, `"consumer"`, `"ip"`, `"header"`, `"cookie"`.  Default: `"none"`.

    `healthchecks.active.`<wbr>`unhealthy.http_failures`<br>*optional* | Number of HTTP failures in active probes (as defined by `healthchecks.active.unhealthy.http_statuses`) to consider a target unhealthy. Default: `0`.
    `healthchecks.active.`<wbr>`unhealthy.interval`<br>*optional* | Interval between active health checks for unhealthy targets (in seconds). A value of zero indicates that active probes for unhealthy targets should not be performed. Default: `0`.
    `healthchecks.active.`<wbr>`http_path`<br>*optional* | Path to use in GET HTTP request to run as a probe on active health checks. Default: `"/"`.
    `healthchecks.active.`<wbr>`timeout`<br>*optional* | Socket timeout for active health checks (in seconds). Default: `1`.
    `healthchecks.active.`<wbr>`healthy.http_statuses`<br>*optional* | An array of HTTP statuses to consider a success, indicating healthiness, when returned by a probe in active health checks.

    `healthchecks.active.`<wbr>`https_sni`<br>*optional* | The hostname to use as an SNI (Server Name Identification) when performing active health checks using HTTPS. This is particularly useful when Targets are configured using IPs, so that the target host's certificate can be verified with the proper SNI.
    `healthchecks.active.`<wbr>`concurrency`<br>*optional* | Number of targets to check concurrently in active health checks. Default: `10`.
    `healthchecks.active.type`<br>*optional* | Whether to perform active health checks using HTTP or HTTPS, or just attempt a TCP connection. Accepted values are: `"tcp"`, `"http"`, `"https"`, `"grpc"`, `"grpcs"`.  Default: `"http"`.

<div class="alert alert-info.blue" role="alert">
  This page refers to the Admin API for running Kong configured with a
  database (Postgres or Cassandra). For using the Admin API for Kong
  in DB-less mode, please refer to the
  <a href="/{{page.kong_version}}/db-less-admin-api">Admin API for DB-less Mode</a>
  page.
</div>

Kong comes with an **internal** RESTful Admin API for administration purposes.
Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will
keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

- `8001` is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
- `8444` is the default port for HTTPS traffic to the Admin API.

This API is designed for internal use and provides full control over Kong, so
care should be taken when setting up Kong environments to avoid undue public
exposure of this API. See [this document][secure-admin-api] for a discussion
of methods to secure the Admin API.

## Supported Content Types

The Admin API accepts 3 content types on every endpoint:

- **application/json**

Handy for complex bodies (ex: complex plugin configuration), in that case simply send
a JSON representation of the data you want to send. Example:

```json
{
    "config": {
        "limit": 10,
        "period": "seconds"
    }
}
```

An example adding a Route to a Service named `test-service`:

```
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/test-service/routes \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"name": "test-route", "paths": [ "/path/one", "/path/two" ]}'
```

- **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**

Simple enough for basic request bodies, you will probably use it most of the time.
Note that when sending nested values, Kong expects nested objects to be referenced
with dotted keys. Example:

```
config.limit=10&config.period=seconds
```

When specifying arrays, send the values in order, or use square brackets (numbering
inside the brackets is optional but if provided it must be 1-indexed, and
consecutive). An example Route added to a Service named `test-service`:

```
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/test-service/routes \
     -d "name=test-route" \
     -d "paths[1]=/path/one" \
     -d "paths[2]=/path/two"
```

The following two examples are identical to the one above, but less explicit:
```
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/test-service/routes \
     -d "name=test-route" \
     -d "paths[]=/path/one" \
     -d "paths[]=/path/two"

curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/test-service/routes \
    -d "name=test-route" \
    -d "paths=/path/one" \
    -d "paths=/path/two"
```


- **multipart/form-data**

Similar to URL-encoded, this content type uses dotted keys to reference nested
objects. Here is an example of sending a Lua file to the pre-function Kong plugin:

```
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/plugin-testing/plugins \
     -F "name=pre-function" \
     -F "config.access=@custom-auth.lua"
```

When specifying arrays for this content-type, the array indices must be specified.
An example Route added to a Service named `test-service`:

```
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:8001/services/test-service/routes \
     -F "name=test-route" \
     -F "paths[1]=/path/one" \
     -F "paths[2]=/path/two"
```

### Validate A Configuration against A Schema

Check validity of a configuration against its entity schema.
This allows you to test your input before submitting a request
to the entity endpoints of the Admin API.

Note that this only performs the schema validation checks,
checking that the input configuration is well-formed.
A requests to the entity endpoint using the given configuration
may still fail due to other reasons, such as invalid foreign
key relationships or uniqueness check failures against the
contents of the data store.


<div class="endpoint post">/schemas/{entity}/validate</div>

#### Response

```
HTTP 200 OK
```

```json
{
    "message": "schema validation successful"
}

### Retrieve Node Status

Retrieve usage information about a node, with some basic information
about the connections being processed by the underlying nginx process,
the status of the database connection, and node's memory usage.

If you want to monitor the Kong process, since Kong is built on top
of nginx, every existing nginx monitoring tool or agent can be used.

          }, {

    }
}
```

* `memory`: Metrics about the memory usage.
    * `workers_lua_vms`: An array with all workers of the Kong node, where each
      entry contains:
    * `http_allocated_gc`: HTTP submodule's Lua virtual machine's memory
      usage information, as reported by `collectgarbage("count")`, for every
      active worker, i.e. a worker that received a proxy call in the last 10
      seconds.
    * `pid`: worker's process identification number.
    * `lua_shared_dicts`: An array of information about dictionaries that are
      shared with all workers in a Kong node, where each array node contains how
      much memory is dedicated for the specific shared dictionary (`capacity`)
      and how much of said memory is in use (`allocated_slabs`).
      These shared dictionaries have least recent used (LRU) eviction
      capabilities, so a full dictionary, where `allocated_slabs == capacity`,
      will work properly. However for some dictionaries, e.g. cache HIT/MISS
      shared dictionaries, increasing their size can be beneficial for the
      overall performance of a Kong node.
  * The memory usage unit and precision can be changed using the querystring
    arguments `unit` and `scale`:
      * `unit`: one of `b/B`, `k/K`, `m/M`, `g/G`, which will return results
        in bytes, kibibytes, mebibytes, or gibibytes, respectively. When
        "bytes" are requested, the memory values in the response will have a
        number type instead of string. Defaults to `m`.
      * `scale`: the number of digits to the right of the decimal points when
        values are given in human-readable memory strings (unit other than
        "bytes"). Defaults to `2`.
      You can get the shared dictionaries memory usage in kibibytes with 4
      digits of precision by doing: `GET /status?unit=k&scale=4`
* `server`: Metrics about the nginx HTTP/S server.
    * `total_requests`: The total number of client requests.
    * `connections_active`: The current number of active client
      connections including Waiting connections.
    * `connections_accepted`: The total number of accepted client
      connections.
    * `connections_handled`: The total number of handled connections.
      Generally, the parameter value is the same as accepts unless
      some resource limits have been reached.
    * `connections_reading`: The current number of connections
      where Kong is reading the request header.
    * `connections_writing`: The current number of connections
      where nginx is writing the response back to the client.
    * `connections_waiting`: The current number of idle client
      connections waiting for a request.
* `database`: Metrics about the database.
    * `reachable`: A boolean value reflecting the state of the
      database connection. Please note that this flag **does not**
      reflect the health of the database itself.

## Tags

Tags are strings associated to entities in Kong. Each tag must be composed of one or more
alphanumeric characters, `_`, `-`, `.` or `~`.

Most core entities can be *tagged* via their `tags` attribute, upon creation or edition.

Tags can be used to filter core entities as well, via the `?tags` querystring parameter.

For example: if you normally get a list of all the Services by doing:

```
GET /services
```

You can get the list of all the Services tagged `example` by doing:

```
GET /services?tags=example
```

Similarly, if you want to filter Services so that you only get the ones tagged `example` *and*
`admin`, you can do that like so:

```
GET /services?tags=example,admin
```

Finally, if you wanted to filter the Services tagged `example` *or* `admin`, you could use:

```
GET /services?tags=example/admin
```

Some notes:

* A maximum of 5 tags can be queried simultaneously in a single request with `,` or `/`
* Mixing operators is not supported: if you try to mix `,` with `/` in the same querystring,
  you will receive an error.
* You may need to quote and/or escape some characters when using them from the
  command line.
* Filtering by `tags` is not supported in foreign key relationship endpoints. For example,
  the `tags` parameter will be ignored in a request such as `GET /services/foo/routes?tags=a,b`
* `offset` parameters are not guaranteed to work if the `tags` parameter is altered or removed


### List All Tags

Returns a paginated list of all the tags in the system.

The list of entities will not be restricted to a single entity type: all the
entities tagged with tags will be present on this list.

If an entity is tagged with more than one tag, the `entity_id` for that entity
will appear more than once in the resulting list. Similarly, if several entities
have been tagged with the same tag, the tag will appear in several items of this list.

## Service Object

Service entities, as the name implies, are abstractions of each of your own
upstream services. Examples of Services would be a data transformation
microservice, a billing API, etc.

The main attribute of a Service is its URL (where Kong should proxy traffic
to), which can be set as a single string or by specifying its `protocol`,
`host`, `port` and `path` individually.

Services are associated to Routes (a Service can have many Routes associated
with it). Routes are entry-points in Kong and define rules to match client
requests. Once a Route is matched, Kong proxies the request to its associated
Service. See the [Proxy Reference][proxy-reference] for a detailed explanation
of how Kong proxies traffic.

Services can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

## Route Object

Route entities define rules to match client requests. Each Route is
associated with a Service, and a Service may have multiple Routes associated to
it. Every request matching a given Route will be proxied to its associated
Service.

The combination of Routes and Services (and the separation of concerns between
them) offers a powerful routing mechanism with which it is possible to define
fine-grained entry-points in Kong leading to different upstream services of
your infrastructure.

You need at least one matching rule that applies to the protocol being matched
by the Route. Depending on the protocols configured to be matched by the Route
(as defined with the `protocols` field), this means that at least one of the
following attributes must be set:

* For `http`, at least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers` or `paths`;
* For `https`, at least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, `paths` or `snis`;
* For `tcp`, at least one of `sources` or `destinations`;
* For `tls`, at least one of `sources`, `destinations` or `snis`;
* For `grpc`, at least one of `hosts`, `headers` or `paths`;
* For `grpcs`, at least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths` or `snis`.

#### Path handling algorithms

`"v0"` is the behavior used in Kong 0.x and 2.x. It treats `service.path`, `route.path` and request path as
*segments* of a URL. It will always join them via slashes. Given a service path `/s`, route path `/r`
and request path `/re`, the concatenated path will be `/s/re`. If the resulting path is a single slash,
no further transformation is done to it. If it's longer, then the trailing slash is removed.

`"v1"` is the behavior used in Kong 1.x. It treats `service.path` as a *prefix*, and ignores the initial
slashes of the request and route paths. Given service path `/s`, route path `/r` and request path `/re`,
the concatenated path will be `/sre`.

Both versions of the algorithm detect "double slashes" when combining paths, replacing them by single
slashes.

In the following table, `s` is the Service and `r` is the Route.

| `s.path` | `r.path` | `r.strip_path` | `r.path_handling` | request path | proxied path  |
|----------|----------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|---------------|
| `/s`     | `/fv0`   | `false`        | `v0`              | `/fv0req`    | `/s/fv0req`   |
| `/s`     | `/fv1`   | `false`        | `v1`              | `/fv1req`    | `/sfv1req`    |
| `/s`     | `/tv0`   | `true`         | `v0`              | `/tv0req`    | `/s/req`      |
| `/s`     | `/tv1`   | `true`         | `v1`              | `/tv1req`    | `/sreq`       |
| `/s`     | `/fv0/`  | `false`        | `v0`              | `/fv0/req`   | `/s/fv0/req`  |
| `/s`     | `/fv1/`  | `false`        | `v1`              | `/fv1/req`   | `/sfv1/req`   |
| `/s`     | `/tv0/`  | `true`         | `v0`              | `/tv0/req`   | `/s/req`      |
| `/s`     | `/tv1/`  | `true`         | `v1`              | `/tv1/req`   | `/sreq`       |

## Consumer Object

The Consumer object represents a consumer - or a user - of a Service. You can
either rely on Kong as the primary datastore, or you can map the consumer list
with your database to keep consistency between Kong and your existing primary
datastore.

Consumers can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

## Plugin Object

A Plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed during
the HTTP request/response lifecycle. It is how you can add functionalities
to Services that run behind Kong, like Authentication or Rate Limiting for
example. You can find more information about how to install and what values
each plugin takes by visiting the [Kong Hub](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/).

When adding a Plugin Configuration to a Service, every request made by a client to
that Service will run said Plugin. If a Plugin needs to be tuned to different
values for some specific Consumers, you can do so by creating a separate
plugin instance that specifies both the Service and the Consumer, through the
`service` and `consumer` fields.

Plugins can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).


```json
{{ page.plugin_json }}
```

See the [Precedence](#precedence) section below for more details.

#### Precedence

A plugin will always be run once and only once per request. But the
configuration with which it will run depends on the entities it has been
configured for.

Plugins can be configured for various entities, combination of entities, or
even globally. This is useful, for example, when you wish to configure a plugin
a certain way for most requests, but make _authenticated requests_ behave
slightly differently.

Therefore, there exists an order of precedence for running a plugin when it has
been applied to different entities with different configurations. The rule of
thumb is: the more specific a plugin is with regards to how many entities it
has been configured on, the higher its priority.

The complete order of precedence when a plugin has been configured multiple
times is:

1. Plugins configured on a combination of: a Route, a Service, and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
2. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
3. Plugins configured on a combination of a Service and a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
4. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Service.
5. Plugins configured on a Consumer.
    (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
6. Plugins configured on a Route.
7. Plugins configured on a Service.
8. Plugins configured to run globally.

**Example**: if the `rate-limiting` plugin is applied twice (with different
configurations): for a Service (Plugin config A), and for a Consumer (Plugin
config B), then requests authenticating this Consumer will run Plugin config B
and ignore A. However, requests that do not authenticate this Consumer will
fallback to running Plugin config A. Note that if config B is disabled
(its `enabled` flag is set to `false`), config A will apply to requests that
would have otherwise matched config B.

## Certificate Object

A certificate object represents a public certificate, and can be optionally paired with the
corresponding private key. These objects are used by Kong to handle SSL/TLS termination for
encrypted requests, or for use as a trusted CA store when validating peer certificate of
client/service. Certificates are optionally associated with SNI objects to
tie a cert/key pair to one or more hostnames.

If intermediate certificates are required in addition to the main
certificate, they should be concatenated together into one string according to
the following order: main certificate on the top, followed by any intermediates.

Certificates can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

## SNI Object

An SNI object represents a many-to-one mapping of hostnames to a certificate.
That is, a certificate object can have many hostnames associated with it; when
Kong receives an SSL request, it uses the SNI field in the Client Hello to
lookup the certificate object based on the SNI associated with the certificate.

SNIs can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

## Upstream Object

The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to loadbalance
incoming requests over multiple services (targets). So for example an upstream
named `service.v1.xyz` for a Service object whose `host` is `service.v1.xyz`.
Requests for this Service would be proxied to the targets defined within the upstream.

An upstream also includes a [health checker][healthchecks], which is able to
enable and disable targets based on their ability or inability to serve
requests. The configuration for the health checker is stored in the upstream
object, and applies to all of its targets.

Upstreams can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).

### Show Upstream Health for Node

Displays the health status for all Targets of a given Upstream, or for
the whole Upstream, according to the perspective of a specific Kong node.
Note that, being node-specific information, making this same request
to different nodes of the Kong cluster may produce different results.
For example, one specific node of the Kong cluster may be experiencing
network issues, causing it to fail to connect to some Targets: these
Targets will be marked as unhealthy by that node (directing traffic from
this node to other Targets that it can successfully reach), but healthy
to all others Kong nodes (which have no problems using that Target).

The `data` field of the response contains an array of Target objects.
The health for each Target is returned in its `health` field:

* If a Target fails to be activated in the balancer due to DNS issues,
  its status displays as `DNS_ERROR`.
* When [health checks][healthchecks] are not enabled in the Upstream
  configuration, the health status for active Targets is displayed as
  `HEALTHCHECKS_OFF`.
* When health checks are enabled and the Target is determined to be healthy,
  either automatically or [manually](#set-target-as-healthy),
  its status is displayed as `HEALTHY`. This means that this Target is
  currently included in this Upstream's load balancer execution.
* When a Target has been disabled by either active or passive health checks
  (circuit breakers) or [manually](#set-target-as-unhealthy),
  its status is displayed as `UNHEALTHY`. The load balancer is not directing
  any traffic to this Target via this Upstream.

When the request query parameter `balancer_health` is set to `1`, the
`data` field of the response refers to the Upstream itself, and its `health`
attribute is defined by the state of all of Upstream's Targets, according
to the field `healthchecks.threshold`.


<div class="endpoint get indent">/upstreams/{name or id}/health/</div>

{:.indent}
Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the Upstream for which to display Target health.

## Target Object

A target is an ip address/hostname with a port that identifies an instance of a backend
service. Every upstream can have many targets, and the targets can be
dynamically added. Changes are effectuated on the fly.

Because the upstream maintains a history of target changes, the targets cannot
be deleted or modified. To disable a target, post a new one with `weight=0`;
alternatively, use the `DELETE` convenience method to accomplish the same.

The current target object definition is the one with the latest `created_at`.

Targets can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](#tags).


```json
{{ page.target_json }}
```

### Set Target Address As Healthy

Set the current health status of an individual address resolved by a target
in the load balancer to "healthy" in the entire Kong cluster.

This endpoint can be used to manually re-enable an address resolved by a
target that was previously disabled by the upstream's [health checker][healthchecks].
Upstreams only forward requests to healthy nodes, so this call tells Kong
to start using this address again.

This resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all workers
of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the "healthy"
status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.


<div class="endpoint post indent">/upstreams/{upstream name or id}/targets/{target or id}/{address}/healthy</div>

Attributes | Description
---:| ---
`upstream name or id`<br>**required** | The unique identifier **or** the name of the upstream.

`address`<br>**required** | The host/port combination element of the address to set as healthy.


#### Response

```
HTTP 204 No Content

---

### Set Target Address As Unhealthy

Set the current health status of an individual address resolved by a target
in the load balancer to "unhealthy" in the entire Kong cluster.

This endpoint can be used to manually disable an address and have it stop
responding to requests. Upstreams only forward requests to healthy nodes, so
this call tells Kong to start skipping this address.

This call resets the health counters of the health checkers running in all
workers of the Kong node, and broadcasts a cluster-wide message so that the
"unhealthy" status is propagated to the whole Kong cluster.

[Active health checks][active] continue to execute for unhealthy
addresses. Note that if active health checks are enabled and the probe detects
that the address is actually healthy, it will automatically re-enable it again.
To permanently remove a target from the balancer, you should [delete a
target](#delete-target) instead.
