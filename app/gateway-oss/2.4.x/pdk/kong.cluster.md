## kong.cluster

Cluster-level utilities



### kong.cluster.get_id()

Returns the unique id for this Kong cluster.  If Kong
 is running in DB-less mode without a cluster ID explicitly defined,
 then this method returns nil.

 For Hybrid mode, all Control Planes and Data Planes belonging to the same
 cluster returns the same cluster ID. For traditional database based
 deployments, all Kong nodes pointing to the same database will also return
 the same cluster ID.


**Returns**

1.  `string|nil` The v4 UUID used by this cluster as its id

1.  `string|nil` an error message


**Usage**

``` lua
local id, err = kong.cluster.get_id()
if err then
  -- handle error
end

if not id then
  -- no cluster ID is available
end

-- use id here
```
