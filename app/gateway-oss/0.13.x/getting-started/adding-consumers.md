## Introduction

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Before you start:</strong>
  <ol>
    <li>Make sure you've <a href="https://konghq.com/install/">installed Kong</a> &mdash; It should only take a minute!</li>
    <li>Make sure you've <a href="/{{page.kong_version}}/getting-started/quickstart">started Kong</a>.</li>
    <li>Also, make sure you've <a href="/{{page.kong_version}}/getting-started/configuring-a-service">configured your Service in Kong</a>.</li>
  </ol>
</div>

In the last section, we learned how to add plugins to Kong. In this section
we're going to learn how to add consumers to your Kong instances. Consumers are
associated to individuals using your API and can be used for tracking, access
management, and more.

**Note:** This section assumes you have [enabled][enabling-plugins] the
[key-auth][key-auth] plugin. If you haven't, you can either [enable the
plugin][enabling-plugins] or skip steps two and three.

## 1. Create a Consumer through the RESTful API

    Lets create a user named `Jason` by issuing the following request:

    ```bash
    $ curl -i -X POST \
      --url http://localhost:8001/consumers/ \
      --data "username=Jason"
    ```

    You should see a response similar to the one below:

    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Content-Type: application/json
    Connection: keep-alive

    {
      "username": "Jason",
      "created_at": 1428555626000,
      "id": "bbdf1c48-19dc-4ab7-cae0-ff4f59d87dc9"
    }
    ```

    Congratulations! You've just added your first consumer to Kong.

    **Note:** Kong also accepts a `custom_id` parameter when [creating
    consumers][API-consumers] to associate a consumer with your existing user
    database.

## 2. Provision key credentials for your Consumer

    Now, we can create a key for our recently created consumer `Jason` by
    issuing the following request:

    ```bash
    $ curl -i -X POST \
      --url http://localhost:8001/consumers/Jason/key-auth/ \
      --data 'key=ENTER_KEY_HERE'
    ```

## 3. Verify that your Consumer credentials are valid

    We can now issue the following request to verify that the credentials of
    our `Jason` Consumer is valid:

    ```bash
    $ curl -i -X GET \
      --url http://localhost:8000 \
      --header "Host: example.com" \
      --header "apikey: ENTER_KEY_HERE"
    ```

Plugins, feel free to read more on Kong in one of the following documents:
