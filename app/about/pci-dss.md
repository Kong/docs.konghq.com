The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is a set of industry-mandated requirements that apply to any business that handles, processes, or stores credit cards, regardless of the business's size or location.

With a payment processing API served through Kong, depending on your setup, you should consider the following scenarios:

- **Proxying Payment Data:** Falls under the criterion of *"processing"*.

- **Logging & Analytics:** A logging plugin might store credit card data on disk or a remote location *(given your API configuration)*; this would trigger the *"storage"* criterion.

You will still need to complete an annual [Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/merchants/self_assessment_form.php) in order to be PCI compliant. There are several different types of SAQs, and a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) can help you choose the right one for your business and achieve compliance.
