<!-- Deployment Options section; used in all Enterprise installation topics - except k8s -->
The installation instructions explain how to deploy {{site.base_gateway}} in its entirety on a single node -- with or without a database.

The instructions are the same for setting up a Control Plane instance in Hybrid mode. After you set up the Control Plane, you set up additional Gateway instances for the Data Planes. See [Hybrid Mode Setup](/gateway/{{include.kong_version}}/plan-and-deploy/hybrid-mode/hybrid-mode-setup) for details.
