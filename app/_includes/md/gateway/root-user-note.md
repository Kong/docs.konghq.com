> **Important:** When you start {{site.base_gateway}}, the NGINX master process runs as `root`, and the worker processes
run as `kong` by default. If this is not the desired behavior, you can switch the NGINX master process
to run on the built-in `kong` user or to a custom non-root user before starting {{site.base_gateway}}.
