> The following examples are built with simplicity in mind, and 
are not meant for a production environment.
> Because `httpbin.org` is the upstream service in these examples, we highly 
recommended that you **do not** run these examples with a production identity 
provider as there is a high chance of leaking information.
> The examples also use the plain HTTP protocol, which you should
**never** use in production.
