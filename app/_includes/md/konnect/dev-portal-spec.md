<!-- Used in Konnect getting started guides -->

Every version can have one OpenAPI spec associated with it, in JSON or YAML format.

If you brought your own spec, use it in the following example. Otherwise, you can
use the [sample Vitals spec](/konnect/vitalsSpec.yaml) for testing.

1. On the Service version page, find the the **Version Spec** section and click **Upload Spec**.

1. Select a spec file to upload.

    The spec must be in YAML or JSON format. To test this functionality, you
    can use [vitalsSpec.yaml](/konnect/vitalsSpec.yaml) as a sample spec.

This OpenAPI spec will be shown under the version name when this Service is
published to the Dev Portal.
