<!-- Shared between Konnect gateway runtime config topics: Docker, Kubernetes, and kong.conf -->
1. In Konnect, from the left navigation menu, select {% konnect_icon runtimes %}
**Runtime Manager**.

1. Select a runtime group.

1. Click **+ New Runtime Instance**.

1. Open the tab that suits your environment: **Linux** or **Kubernetes**.

    For an advanced **Docker** setup using custom configuration values, use
    either tab. Do not use the **Quick Setup** tab.

1. Click **Generate Certificate**.

    Two new fields appear: a certificate and a private key.
    The contents of these fields are unique to each runtime configuration.

1. Save the contents of each field into a separate file in a safe location:

    * Certificate: `tls.crt`
    * Private key: `tls.key`

    If you navigate away from this page before saving all of the
    certificate and key files, you will need to regenerate them.

1. Store the files on your runtime instance's local filesystem.

{:.note}
> **Note:** The certificates generated by Konnect have a ten (10) year expiration
date by default. If you bring your own certificates, make sure to monitor the
expiration date. To rotate certificates, see
[Renew Certificates](/konnect/runtime-manager/runtime-instances/renew-certificates).

Keep the configuration page open for the next section, as you'll need to refer
back to it for the configuration parameters.
