<!-- Shared between Konnect gateway runtime config topics: Docker, Kubernetes, and kong.conf -->
1. In {{site.konnect_short_name}}, select {% konnect_icon runtimes %}
**Runtime Manager**.

1. Select a runtime group.

1. Click **New Runtime Instance**.

1. Open the tab for either **Linux** or **Kubernetes**.

    For an advanced **Docker** setup using custom configuration values, use
    either tab. Do not use the **Quick Setup** tab.

1. Click **Generate Certificate**.

    Two new fields appear: a certificate and a private key.
    The contents of these fields are unique to each runtime configuration.

1. Save the contents of each field into a separate file in a safe location:

    * Certificate: `tls.crt`
    * Private key: `tls.key`

    If you navigate away from this page before saving all of the
    certificate and key files, you will need to regenerate them.

1. Store the files on the local filesystem of the runtime instance.

{:.note}
> **Note:** The certificates generated by {{site.konnect_short_name}} have a ten year expiration
date by default. If you bring your own certificates, make sure to monitor the
expiration date. To rotate certificates, see
[Renew Certificates](/konnect/runtime-manager/runtime-instances/renew-certificates).
