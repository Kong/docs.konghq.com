<!-- Used in Konnect getting started guides -->

Konnect supports
[GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/) (GFM) for API
descriptions.

1. Write a description for your API in Markdown (`.md`).

    If you don't have a file you can use for testing, copy the following text
    into a blank `.md` file:

    ```md
    Here's a description with some **formatting**.

    Here's a bulleted list:
    * One
    * Two
    * Three

    You can [add relative links](/) and [absolute links](https://cloud.konghq.com).

    Try adding a codeblock for code snippets:

        This is a test

    ```

1. In Konnect, find the **Service Document** section on your Service's overview
page and click **Upload Document**.

1. Locate the `.md` file and click **Open**.

The contents of this markdown file will be displayed as the introduction to
your API when this Service is published to the Dev Portal.
