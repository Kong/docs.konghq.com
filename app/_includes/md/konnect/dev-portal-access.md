<!-- Used in Konnect getting started guides -->

In this section, you can take one of two paths: keep the Dev Portal private
and require a login, or switch it to public, making it visible to anyone with
a link.

If you choose to make the Dev Portal public, application registration
will not be available.

{:.note}
> **Note:** The Dev Portal is a separate site that requires its own credentials.
You can't use your Konnect credentials to log in here.
