{{site.base_gateway}} data planes proxy service traffic.

1. From the left navigation menu, open {% konnect_icon runtimes %} **Runtime Manager**.

1. Select a runtime group.

1. Click **+ Add runtime instance**.

     The page opens to a runtime configuration form with the Docker tab
     selected.

1. Click **Copy Script**.

1. Replace the placeholder for `<your-password>` with your own
{{site.konnect_saas}} password.

1. Run the script on any host you choose.

    This script creates a Docker container running a
    {{site.base_gateway}} instance and connects it to your
    {{site.konnect_saas}} account.

1. Click **Done** to go to the Runtime Instances page.

Once the script has finished running, the runtime instances table will include
a new entry for your instance and the tag in the **Sync Status** column should
say **Connected**.

The default proxy URL for this runtime is `http://localhost:8000`. Take
note of this URL, as you'll need it later to access a Service
implementation.
