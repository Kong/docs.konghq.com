    **Note:** When you start Kong, by default, the Nginx master process will run
    as `root` and the worker processes will run as `nobody`.
    If this is not the desired behavior, you can switch to the built-in
    `kong` user and group before starting Kong.
    See [Running Kong as a Non-Root User](/latest/kong-user)
    for more information.
