{% if include.hub_example.auth_plugin? %}

As this is an auth plugin, you need to create a consumer and attach a credential to it.

Create a consumer:

```bash
resource "konnect_gateway_consumer" "alex" {
  username         = "alex"
  custom_id        = "alex-custom"
  control_plane_id = konnect_gateway_control_plane.my_konnect_cp.id
}
```

Create a {{ include.hub_example.plugin_name }} credential attached to this consumer:

{% assign plugin_name = include.hub_example.plugin_name | replace: "-","_" %}
```hcl
resource "konnect_gateway_{{ plugin_name }}" "my_{{ plugin_name }}" {
{%- for field in include.hub_example.auth_fields %}
  {{ field[0] }} = {{ field[1] | quote }}{% endfor %}

  consumer_id      = konnect_gateway_consumer.alex.id
  control_plane_id = konnect_gateway_control_plane.my_konnect_cp.id
}
```
{% endif %}
