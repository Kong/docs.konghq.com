  Validate access tokens sent by developers using a third-party OAuth 2.0
  Authorization Server, by leveraging its Introspection Endpoint
  ([RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662)). This plugin assumes that
  the Consumer already has an access token that will be validated against a
  third-party OAuth 2.0 server.
