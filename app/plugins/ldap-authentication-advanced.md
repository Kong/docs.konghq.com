## Enterprise Features

#### Consumer Mapping

When authenticating via Kong, it is sometimes advantageous to apply plugin 
behavior at the consumer level (e.g. rate-limiting); as such, the following 
options are provided:

field               | required | default                  | description |
--------------------|----------|--------------------------|-------------|          
`consumer_by`       |          | `{ username, custom_id }`| Find consumers by `consumer_by fields and map to ldap-auth user This will set the authenticated consumer so that X-Consumer-{ID, USERNAME, CUSTOM_ID} headers are set and consumer functionality is available. |
`consumer_optional` |          | `false`                  | By default, the consumer mapping is NOT optional. Set this config to `true` when you do NOT want the plugin to map to a kong consumer.|
