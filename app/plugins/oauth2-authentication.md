Add an OAuth 2.0 authentication layer with the [Authorization Code
Grant][authorization-code-grant], [Client Credentials][client-credentials],
[Implicit Grant][implicit-grant] or [Resource Owner Password Credentials
Grant][password-grant] flow.

<br />

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> As per the OAuth2 specs, this plugin requires the
  underlying API to be served over HTTPS. To avoid any confusion, we
  recommend that you configure your underlying API to be only served through
  HTTPS.
  <br />
  <br />
  If you are running Kong >= 0.10.0, you can learn to do so in the
  <a href="/docs/latest/proxy#configuring-ssl-for-an-api">Proxy Reference</a>
  where the <code>https_only</code> option is documented.
  <br />
  <br />
  If you are running Kong < 0.10.0, you must configure the
  <a href="/plugins/dynamic-ssl">SSL Plugin</a> on your API to have such an
  <code>https_only</code> flag.
</div>

----

## Configuration

Configuring the plugin is straightforward, you can add it on top of an [API][api-object] by executing the following request on your Kong server:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \
    --data "name=oauth2" \
    --data "config.enable_authorization_code=true" \
    --data "config.scopes=email,phone,address" \
    --data "config.mandatory_scope=true"
```

`api`: The `id` or `name` of the API that this plugin configuration will target.

You can also apply it for every API using the `http://kong:8001/plugins/` endpoint. Read the [Plugin Reference](/docs/latest/admin-api/#add-plugin) for more information.

## Usage

In order to use the plugin, you first need to create a consumer to associate one or more credentials to. The Consumer represents a developer using the final service/API.

### Endpoints

By default the OAuth 2.0 plugin listens on the following endpoints when consuming the API on the [proxy port][proxy-port]:

Endpoint                     | description
---                         | ---
`/oauth2/authorize`          | The endpoint to the Authorization Server that provisions authorization codes for the [Authorization Code][authorization-code-grant] flow, or the access token when the [Implicit Grant][implicit-grant] flow is enabled. Only `POST` is supported.
`/oauth2/token`              | The endpoint to the Authorization Server that provision access tokens. This is also the only endpoint to use for the [Client Credentials][client-credentials] and [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant][password-grant] flows. Only `POST` is supported.

The clients trying to authorize and request access tokens must use these endpoints. Remember that the endpoints above must be combined with the right URI path or headers that you normally use when consuming the root `/` endpoint of the API through Kong.

### Create a Consumer

You need to associate a credential to an existing [Consumer][consumer-object] object, that represents a user consuming the API. To create a [Consumer][consumer-object] you can execute the following request:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/consumers/ \
    --data "username=user123" \
    --data "custom_id=SOME_CUSTOM_ID"
```

parameter                       | default | description
---                             | ---     | ---
`username`<br>*semi-optional*   |         | The username of the consumer. Either this field or `custom_id` must be specified.
`custom_id`<br>*semi-optional*  |         | A custom identifier used to map the consumer to another database. Either this field or `username` must be specified.

A [Consumer][consumer-object] can have many credentials.

### Create an Application

Then you can finally provision new OAuth 2.0 credentials (also called "OAuth applications") by making the following HTTP request:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/consumers/{consumer_id}/oauth2 \
    --data "name=Test%20Application" \
    --data "client_id=SOME-CLIENT-ID" \
    --data "client_secret=SOME-CLIENT-SECRET" \
    --data "redirect_uri=http://some-domain/endpoint/"
```

`consumer_id`: The [Consumer][consumer-object] entity to associate the credentials to

form parameter                | default | description
---                           | ---     | ---
`name`                        |         | The name to associate to the credential. In OAuth 2.0 this would be the application name.
`client_id`<br>*optional*     |         | You can optionally set your own unique `client_id`. If missing, the plugin will generate one.
`client_secret`<br>*optional* |         | You can optionally set your own unique `client_secret`. If missing, the plugin will generate one.
`redirect_uri`                |         | The URL in your app where users will be sent after authorization ([RFC 6742 Section 3.1.2][redirect-uri])

## Migrating Access Tokens

If you are migrating your existing OAuth 2.0 applications and access tokens over to Kong, then you can:

* Migrate consumers and applications by creating OAuth 2.0 applications as explained above.
* Migrate access tokens using the `/oauth2_tokens` endpoints in the Kong's Admin API. For example:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/oauth2_tokens \
    --data "credential_id=KONG-APPLICATION-ID" \
    --data "token_type=bearer" \
    --data "access_token=SOME-TOKEN" \
    --data "refresh_token=SOME-TOKEN" \
    --data "expires_in=3600"
```

form parameter                        | default | description
---                                   | ---     | ---
`credential_id`                       |         | The ID of the OAuth 2.0 application created on Kong.
`token_type`<br>*optional*            | `bearer`| The [token type][token-types].
`access_token`<br>*optional*          |         | You can optionally set your own access token value, otherwise a random string will be generated.
`refresh_token`<br>*optional*         |         | You can optionally set your own unique refresh token value, otherwise a random string will be generated.
`expires_in`                          |         | The expiration time (in seconds) of the access token.
`scope`<br>*optional*                 |         | The authorized scope associated with the token.
`authenticated_userid`<br>*optional*  |         | The custom ID of the user who authorized the application.

## Upstream Headers

When a client has been authenticated and authorized, the plugin will append some headers to the request before proxying it to the upstream API/Microservice, so that you can identify the consumer and the end-user in your code:

* `X-Consumer-ID`, the ID of the Consumer on Kong
* `X-Consumer-Custom-ID`, the `custom_id` of the Consumer (if set)
* `X-Consumer-Username`, the `username` of the Consumer (if set)
* `X-Authenticated-Scope`, the comma-separated list of scopes that the end user has authenticated, if available (only if the consumer is not the 'anonymous' consumer)
* `X-Authenticated-Userid`, the logged-in user ID who has granted permission to the client (only if the consumer is not the 'anonymous' consumer)
* `X-Anonymous-Consumer`, will be set to `true` when authentication failed, and the 'anonymous' consumer was set instead.

You can use this information on your side to implement additional logic. You can use the `X-Consumer-ID` value to query the Kong Admin API and retrieve more information about the Consumer.

## OAuth 2.0 Flows

## Client Credentials

The [Client Credentials][client-credentials] flow will work out of the box, without building any authorization page. The clients will need to use the `/oauth2/token` endpoint to request an access token.

### Authorization Code

After provisioning Consumers and associating OAuth 2.0 credentials to them, it is important to understand how the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow works. As opposed to most of the Kong plugins, the OAuth 2.0 plugin requires some little additional work on your side to make everything work well:

* You **must** implement an authorization page on your web application, that will talk with the plugin server-side.
* *Optionally* you need to explain on your website/documentation how to consume your OAuth 2.0 protected services, so that developers accessing your service know how to build their client implementations

#### The flow explained

Building the authorization page is going to be the primary task that the plugin itself cannot do out of the box, because it requires to check that the user is properly logged in, and this operation is strongly tied with your authentication implementation.

The authorization page is made of two parts:

* The frontend page that the user will see, and that will allow him to authorize the client application to access his data
* The backend that will process the HTML form displayed in the frontend, that will talk with the OAuth 2.0 plugin on Kong, and that will ultimately redirect the user to a third party URL.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <div class="container" style="text-align: center;">
    <a href="{{ site.repos.oauth2_hello_world }}">You can see a sample implementation in node.js + express.js on GitHub</a>
  </div>
</div>

A diagram representing this flow:

<div class="alert alert-info">
  <a title="OAuth 2.0 Flow" href="/assets/images/docs/oauth2/oauth2-flow.png" target="_blank"><img src="/assets/images/docs/oauth2/oauth2-flow.png"/></a>
</div>

1. The client application will redirect the end user to the authorization page on your web application, passing `client_id`, `response_type` and `scope` (if required) as querystring parameters. This is a sample authorization page:
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <center><img title="OAuth 2.0 Prompt" src="/assets/images/docs/oauth2/oauth2-prompt.png"/></center>
    </div>

2. Before showing the actual authorization page, the web application will make sure that the user is logged in.

3. The client application will send the `client_id` in the querystring, from which the web application can retrieve both the OAuth 2.0 application name, and developer name, by making the following request to Kong:

    ```bash
    $ curl kong:8001/oauth2?client_id=XXX
    ```

4. If the end user authorized the application, the form will submit the data to your backend with a `POST` request, sending the `client_id`, `response_type` and `scope` parameters that were placed in `<input type="hidden" .. />` fields.

5. The backend must add the `provision_key` and `authenticated_userid` parameters to the `client_id`, `response_type` and `scope` parameters and it will make a `POST` request to Kong at your API address, on the `/oauth2/authorize` endpoint. If an `Authorization` header has been sent by the client, that must be added too. The equivalent of:

    ```bash
    $ curl https://your.api.com/oauth2/authorize \
        --header "Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW" \
        --data "client_id=XXX" \
        --data "response_type=XXX" \
        --data "scope=XXX" \
        --data "provision_key=XXX" \
        --data "authenticated_userid=XXX"
    ```

    The `provision_key` is the key the plugin has generated when it has been added to the API, while `authenticated_userid` is the ID of the logged-in end user who has granted the permission.

6. Kong will respond with a JSON response:

    ```json
    {
      "redirect_uri": "http://some/url"
    }
    ```

    With either a `200 OK` or `400 Bad Request` response code depending if the request was successful or not.
7. In **both** cases, ignore the response status code and just redirect the user to whatever URI is being returned in the `redirect_uri` property.

8. The client appication will take it from here, and will continue the flow with Kong with no other interaction with your web application. Like exchaging the authorization code for an access token if it's an Authorization Code Grant flow.

9. Once the Access Token has been retrieved, the client application will make requests on behalf of the user to your final API.

10. Access Tokens can expire, and when that happens the client application needs to renew the Access Token with Kong and retreive a new one.

In this flow, the steps that you need to implement are:

* The login page, you probably already have it (step 2)
* The Authorization page, with its backend that will simply collect the values, make a `POST` request to Kong and redirect the user to whatever URL Kong has returned (steps 3 to 7).

----

## Resource Owner Password Credentials

The [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant][password-grant] is a much simpler version of the Authorization Code flow, but it still requires to build an authorization backend (without the frontend) in order to make it work properly.

![OAuth 2.0 Flow](/assets/images/docs/oauth2/oauth2-flow2.png)

1. On the first request, the client application make a request including some OAuth2 parameters, including `username` and `password` parameters, to your web-application.

2. The backend of your web-application will authenticate the `username` and `password` sent by the client, and if successful will add the `provision_key`, `authenticated_userid` and `grant_type` parameters to the parameters originally sent by the client, and it will make a `POST` request to Kong at your API address, on the `/oauth2/token` endpoint. If an `Authorization` header has been sent by the client, that must be added too. The equivalent of:

    ```bash
    $ curl https://your.api.com/oauth2/token \
        --header "Authorization: Basic czZCaGRSa3F0MzpnWDFmQmF0M2JW" \
        --data "client_id=XXX" \
        --data "client_secret=XXX" \
        --data "grant_type=password" \
        --data "scope=XXX" \
        --data "provision_key=XXX" \
        --data "authenticated_userid=XXX" \
        --data "username=XXX" \
        --data "password=XXX"
    ```

    The `provision_key` is the key the plugin has generated when it has been added to the API, while `authenticated_userid` is the ID of the end user whose `username` and `password` belong to.

3. Kong will respond with a JSON response

4. The JSON response sent by Kong must be sent back to the original client as it is. If the operation is successful, this response will include an access token, otherwise it will include an error.

In this flow, the steps that you need to implement are:

* The backend endpoint that will process the original request and will authenticate the `username` and `password` values sent by the client, and if the authentication is successful, make the request to Kong and return back to the client whatever response Kong has sent back.

----

## Refresh Token

When your access token expires, you can generate a new access token using the refresh token you received in conjunction to your expired access token.

```bash
$ curl -X POST https://your.api.com/oauth2/token \
    --data "grant_type=refresh_token" \
    --data "client_id=XXX" \
    --data "client_secret=XXX" \
    --data "refresh_token=XXX"
```
