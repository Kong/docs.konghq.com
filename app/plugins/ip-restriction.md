Restrict access to an API by either whitelisting or blacklisting IP addresses. Single IPs, multiple IPs or ranges in [CIDR notation][cidr] like `10.10.10.0/24` can be used.

## Configuration

Configuring the plugin is straightforward, you can add it on top of an [API][api-object] (or [Consumer][consumer-object]) by executing the following request on your Kong server:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \
    --data "name=ip-restriction" \
    --data "config.whitelist=54.13.21.1, 143.1.0.0/24"
```

`api`: The `id` or `name` of the API that this plugin configuration will target

You can also apply it for every API using the `http://kong:8001/plugins/` endpoint. Read the [Plugin Reference](/docs/latest/admin-api/#add-plugin) for more information.

`name`                          |         | The name of the plugin to use, in this case: `ip-restriction`
`consumer_id`<br>*optional*     |         | The CONSUMER ID that this plugin configuration will target. This value can only be used if [authentication has been enabled][faq-authentication] so that the system can identify the user making the request.
`config.whitelist`<br>*semi-optional* |   | Comma separated list of IPs or CIDR ranges to whitelist. One of `config.whitelist` or `config.blacklist` must be specified.
`config.blacklist`<br>*semi-optional* |   | Comma separated list of IPs or CIDR ranges to blacklist. One of `config.whitelist` or `config.blacklist` must be specified.

Note that the `whitelist` and `blacklist` models are mutually exclusive in their usage, as they provide complimentary approaches. That is, you cannot configure an ACL with both `whitelist` and `blacklist` configurations. An ACL with a `whitelist` provides a positive security model, in which the configured CIDR ranges are allowed access to the resource, and all others are inherently rejected. By contrast, a `blacklist` configuration provides a negative security model, in which certain CIDRS are explicitly denied access to the resource (and all others are inherently allowed).
