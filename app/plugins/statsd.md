## Metrics

Metrics the plugin supports logging into the StatsD server.

Metric                     | description | namespace
---                        | ---         | ---
`request_count`            | tracks the request | kong.\<api_name>.request.count
`request_size`             | tracks the request's body size in bytes | kong.\<api_name>.request.size
`response_size`            | tracks the response's body size in bytes | kong.\<api_name>.response.size
`latency`                  | tracks the time interval between the request started and response received from the upstream server | kong.\<api_name>.latency
`status_count`             | tracks each status code returned in a response | kong.\<api_name>.status.\<status>.count and kong.\<api_name>.status.\<status>.total
`unique_users`             | tracks unique users who made a requests to the underlying Service/Route (or API)| kong.\<api_name>.user.uniques
`request_per_user`         | tracks request/user | kong.\<api_name>.user.\<consumer_id>.count
`upstream_latency`         | tracks the time it took for the final service to process the request | kong.\<api_name>.upstream_latency
`kong_latency`             | tracks the internal Kong latency that it took to run all the plugins | kong.\<api_name>.kong_latency
`status_count_per_user`    | tracks request/status/user | kong.\<api_name>.user.\<customer_id>.status.\<status> and kong.\<api_name>.user.\<customer_id>.status.total

### Metric Fields

Plugin can be configured with any combination of [Metrics](#metrics), with each entry containing the following fields.

Field         | description                                             | allowed values
---           | ---                                                     | ---
`name`          | StatsD metric's name                                  | [Metrics](#metrics)          
`stat_type`     | determines what sort of event the metric represents   | `gauge`, `timer`, `counter`, `histogram`, `meter` and `set`|
`sample_rate`<br>*conditional*   | sampling rate                        | `number`                 
`customer_identifier`<br>*conditional*| authenticated user detail       | `consumer_id`, `custom_id`, `username`

### Metric Requirements

1.  By default all metrics get logged.
2.  Metric with `stat_type` set to `counter` or `gauge` must have `sample_rate` defined as well.
3.  `unique_users` metric only works with `stat_type` as `set`.
4.  `status_count`, `status_count_per_user` and `request_per_user` work only with `stat_type`  as `counter`.
5.  `status_count_per_user`, `request_per_user` and `unique_users` must have `customer_identifier` defined.


## Kong Process Errors

This logging plugin will only log HTTP request and response data. If you are
looking for the Kong process error file (which is the nginx error file), then
you can find it at the following path:
{[prefix](/{{site.data.kong_latest.release}}/configuration/#prefix)}/logs/error.log
