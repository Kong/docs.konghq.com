Invoke an [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) function from Kong. It
can be used in combination with other request plugins to secure, manage or extend
the function.

----

## Configuration

Configuring the plugin is straightforward, you can add it on top of an
[API][api-object] by executing the following request on your Kong server:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \
    --data "name=aws-lambda" \
    --data-urlencode "config.aws_key=AWS_KEY" \
    --data-urlencode "config.aws_secret=AWS_SECRET" \
    --data "config.aws_region=AWS_REGION" \
    --data "config.function_name=LAMBDA_FUNCTION_NAME"
```

`api`: The `id` or `name` of the API that this plugin configuration will target

You can also apply this plugin for every API using the `http://kong:8001/plugins/`
endpoint. Read the [Plugin Reference](/docs/latest/admin-api/#add-plugin)
for more information.

**Reminder**: curl by default sends payloads with an
`application/x-www-form-urlencoded` MIME type, which will naturally be URL-
decoded by Kong. To ensure special characters that are likely to appear in your
AWS key or secret (like `+`) are correctly decoded, you must URL-encode them,
hence use `--date-urlencode` if you are using curl. Alternatives to this
approach would be to send your payload with a different MIME type (like
`application/json`), or to use a different HTTP client.

`config.keepalive`<br>*optional*           | `60000` | An optional value in milliseconds that defines how long an idle connection will live before being closed

### Sending parameters

Any form parameter sent along with the request, will be also sent as an
argument to the AWS Lambda function.

### Known Issues

#### Use a fake upstream_url

When using the AWS Lambda plugin, the response will be returned by the plugin
itself without proxying the request to any upstream service. This means that
whatever `upstream_url` has been set on the [API][api-object] it will
never be used.

Although `upstream_url` will never be used, it's currently a mandatory field
in Kong's data model and its hostname must be resolvable. So set it to a
fake value (ie, `http://127.0.0.1:20000`) if you are planning to use this
plugin. Failing to do so will result in 500 errors regarding a resolution
failure.

In the future we will provide a more intuitive way to deal with similar
use cases.

#### Response plugins

There is a known limitation in the system that prevents some response plugins
from being executed. We are planning to remove this limitation in the future.
