## How it works

When enabled, this plugin will create a buffer for each of the APIs it is monitoring. The buffer accumulates the logs of this API's traffic. When the API received no traffic for `flush_timeout` or if the number of calls reaches `queue_size`, the buffer is queued for sending to the Galileo collector.

The Galileo collector then processes your logs before you are able to see your traffic on your Galileo dashboard.

## Logging bodies

This plugin can have a performance impact when the `log_bodies` option is enabled. Buffering the bodies is an expansive operation for Kong and depending on their size, can put pressure on the LuaJIT VM.

The buffer will only allow for bodies up to `20MB`, and for up to `200MB` of data queued for sending at once.

When logging bodies, make sure to configure your `queue_size` so that Kong flushes frequently enough to the Galileo collector.

## FAQ

#### Why can't I see my API logs on my Galileo dashboard?

First of all, check the Kong logs for errors at:

```
{nginx_working_dir}/logs/error.log
```

If you don't see anything useful, you can reload Kong with the `debug` log level by editing your configuration file:

```
error_log logs/error.log debug;
```

Now, you should see logs telling you what the plugin is doing, as well as responses from the Galileo collector. If the collector is able to process your data, it means Galileo is correctly receiving it. You'll want to make sure you have configured your plugin to send your data to the right `environment`.

## Kong Process Errors

This logging plugin will only log HTTP request and response data. If you are looking for the Kong process error file (which is the nginx error file), then you can find it at the following path: {[prefix](/{{site.data.kong_latest.release}}/configuration/#prefix)}/logs/error.log
