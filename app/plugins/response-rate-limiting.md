This plugin allows you to limit the number of requests a developer can make based on a custom response header returned by the upstream API. You can arbitrary set as many rate-limiting objects (or quotas) as you want and instruct Kong to increase or decrease them by any number of units. Each custom rate-limiting object can limit the inbound requests per seconds, minutes, hours, days, months or years.

If the API has no authentication layer, the **Client IP** address will be used, otherwise the Consumer will be used if an authentication plugin has been configured.

----

## Configuration

Configuring the plugin is straightforward, you can add it on top of an [API][api-object] (or [Consumer][consumer-object]) by executing the following request on your Kong server:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \
    --data "name=response-ratelimiting" \
    --data "config.limits.{limit_name}.minute=10"
```

`api`: The `id` or `name` of the API that this plugin configuration will target

You can also apply it for every API using the `http://kong:8001/plugins/` endpoint. Read the [Plugin Reference](/docs/latest/admin-api/#add-plugin) for more information.

`name`                              |                | The name of the plugin to use, in this case: `response-ratelimiting`
`consumer_id`<br>*optional*         |                | The CONSUMER ID that this plugin configuration will target. This value can only be used if [authentication has been enabled][faq-authentication] so that the system can identify the user making the request.
`config.limits.{limit_name}`        |                | This is a list of custom objects that you can set on the API, with arbitrary names set in the `{limit_name`} placeholder, like `config.limits.sms.minute=20` if your object is called "SMS".
`config.limits.{limit_name}.second`<br>*semi-optional* | | The amount of HTTP requests the developer can make per second. At least one limit must exist.
`config.limits.{limit_name}.minute`<br>*semi-optional* | | The amount of HTTP requests the developer can make per minute. At least one limit must exist.
`config.limits.{limit_name}.hour`<br>*semi-optional*   | | The amount of HTTP requests the developer can make per hour. At least one limit must exist.
`config.limits.{limit_name}.day`<br>*semi-optional*    | | The amount of HTTP requests the developer can make per day. At least one limit must exist.
`config.limits.{limit_name}.month`<br>*semi-optional*  | | The amount of HTTP requests the developer can make per month. At least one limit must exist.
`config.limits.{limit_name}.year`<br>*semi-optional*   | | The amount of HTTP requests the developer can make per year. At least one limit must exist.
`config.header_name`<br>*optional*                | `X-Kong-Limit`      | The name of the response header used to increment the counters.
`config.block_on_first_violation`<br>*optional*  | `false` | A boolean value that determines if the requests should be blocked as soon as one limit is being exceeded. This will block requests that are supposed to consume other limits too.
`config.limit_by`<br>*optional* | `consumer`  | The entity that will be used when aggregating the limits: `consumer`, `credential`, `ip`. If the `consumer` or the `credential` cannot be determined, the system will always fallback to `ip`.
`config.policy`<br>*optional* | `cluster` | The rate-limiting policies to use for retrieving and incrementing the limits. Available values are `local` (counters will be stored locally in-memory on the node), `cluster` (counters are stored in the datastore and shared across the nodes) and `redis` (counters are stored on a Redis server and will be shared across the nodes).
`config.fault_tolerant`<br>*optional*  | `true` |  A boolean value that determines if the requests should be proxied even if Kong has troubles connecting a third-party datastore. If `true` requests will be proxied anyways effectively disabling the rate-limiting function until the datastore is working again. If `false` then the clients will see `500` errors.
`config.hide_client_headers`<br>*optional* | `false` | Optionally hide informative response headers.
`config.redis_host`<br>*semi-optional* | | When using the `redis` policy, this property specifies the address to the Redis server.
`config.redis_port`<br>*optional* | `6379` | When using the `redis` policy, this property specifies the port of the Redis server.
`config.redis_password`<br>*optional* |      | When using the `redis` policy, this property specifies the password to connect to the Redis server.
`config.redis_timeout`<br>*optional* | `2000` | When using the `redis` policy, this property specifies the timeout in milliseconds of any command submitted to the Redis server.
`config.redis_database`<br>*optional* | `0` | When using the `redis` policy, this property specifies Redis database to use.

## Configuring Quotas

After adding the plugin, you can increment the configured limits by adding the following response header:

```
Header-Name: Limit=Value [,Limit=Value]
```

Since `X-Kong-Limit` is the default header name (you can optionally change it), it will look like:

```
X-Kong-Limit: limitname1=2, limitname2=4
```

That will increment the limit `limitname1` by 2 units, and `limitname2` by 4 units.

You can optionally increment more than one limit by comma separating the entries. The header will be removed before returning the response to the original client.

----

## Headers sent to the client

When this plugin is enabled, Kong will send some additional headers back to the client telling how many units are available and how many are allowed. For example if you created a limit/quota called "Videos" with a per-minute limit:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit-Videos-Minute: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Videos-Minute: 9
```

or it will return a combination of more time limits, if more than one is being set:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit-Videos-Second: 5
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Videos-Second: 5
X-RateLimit-Limit-Videos-Minute: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Videos-Minute: 10
```

If any of the limits configured is being reached, the plugin will return a `HTTP/1.1 429` status code and an empty body.

### Upstream Headers

The plugin will append the usage headers for each limit before proxying it to the upstream API/Microservice, so that you can properly refuse to process the request if there are no more limits remaining. The headers are in the form of `X-RateLimit-Remaining-{limit_name}`, like:

```
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Videos: 3
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Images: 0
```
