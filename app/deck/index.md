decK is a command line tool that lets you orchestrate and automate the entire API delivery process. It is a key part of API Lifecycle Automation (APIOps), including configuring {{ site.base_gateway }} from an existing OpenAPI specification.

decK operates on state files, which represent the intended configuration of {{ site.base_gateway }} in text format. You can configure any core [{{ site.base_gateway }} entity](/deck/reference/entities/) (for example, service, route, plugin) declaratively and apply that configuration to {{ site.base_gateway }} using decK.

## decK commands

decK offers a comprehensive suite of tools for configuring and managing the Kong platform through sets of commands.
The decK commands are structured into three main categories:

* [**Configuration Generation**](/deck/file/): This category focuses on the initial creation of decK state files from industry-standard API specification formats.

* [**Configuration Transformation**](/deck/file/manipulation/): This set of commands provides the tools needed to refine and restructure decK configuration files. It allows for the segmentation of a full configuration into smaller, manageable parts and their subsequent reassembly.

* [**Gateway State Management**](/deck/gateway/): This category includes commands that facilitate the synchronization of the final decK file with the target platform, which can be {{site.konnect_product_name}}, {{site.base_gateway}}, or {{site.kic_product_name}}.

## Declarative configuration

{{ site.base_gateway }} has historically offered two declarative configuration formats, `deck` and `dbless`. The `dbless` format is an internal format used by `kong config db_export` and {{ site.kic_product_name }}.

The `deck` format is the canonical declarative configuration format in this documentation. When the words "declarative configuration" are used, it is to refer to a `deck` format file, _not_ a `dbless` format.
