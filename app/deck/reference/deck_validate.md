## deck validate

Validate the state file

### Synopsis

Validate reads the state file and ensures the validity.

It will read all the state files that are passed in. If there are YAML/JSON
parsing issues, they will be reported. It also checks for foreign relationships
and alerts if there are broken relationships, missing links present.
No communication takes places between decK and Kong during the execution of
this command.
