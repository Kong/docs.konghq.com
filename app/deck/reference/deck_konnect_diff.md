## deck konnect diff

Diff the current entities in Konnect with the one on disks (in alpha)

### Synopsis

Diff is like a dry run of 'decK sync' command.

It will load entities form Konnect and then perform a diff on those with
the entities present in files locally. This allows you to see the entities
that will be created or updated or deleted.

WARNING: This command is currently in alpha state. This command
might have breaking changes in future releases.
