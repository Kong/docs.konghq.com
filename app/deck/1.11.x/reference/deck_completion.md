Generate completion script.

```sh
deck completion [bash|zsh|fish|powershell]
```

## Usage
To load completions, follow the instructions for your shell below.

### Bash

```sh
source <(deck completion bash)
```

To load completions for each session, execute once:

**Linux:**
```sh
deck completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/deck
```

**macOS:**
```sh
deck completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/deck
```

### Zsh

If shell completion is not already enabled in your environment,
you will need to enable it. You can execute the following once:
```sh
echo "autoload -U compinit; compinit" >> ~/.zshrc
```

To load completions for each session, execute once:
```sh
deck completion zsh > "${fpath[1]}/_yourprogram"
```

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

### fish

```sh
deck completion fish | source
```

To load completions for each session, execute once:
```sh
deck completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/deck.fish
```

### PowerShell

```powershell
PS> deck completion powershell | Out-String | Invoke-Expression
```

To load completions for every new session, run:
```powershell
PS> deck completion powershell > deck.ps1
```

Then source this file from your PowerShell profile.
