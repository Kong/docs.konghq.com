title: deck diff
---

The diff command is similar to a dry run of the 'decK sync' command.

It loads entities from Kong and performs a diff with
the entities in local files. This allows you to see the entities
that will be created, updated, or deleted.


```
deck diff [flags]
```

## Flags

```
  -h, --help                  help for diff
      --non-zero-exit-code    return exit code 2 if there is a diff present,
                              exit code 0 if no diff is found,
                              and exit code 1 if an error occurs.
      --parallelism int       Maximum number of concurrent operations. (default 10)
      --rbac-resources-only   sync only the RBAC resources (Kong Enterprise only).
      --select-tag strings    only entities matching tags specified via this flag are diffed.
                              When this setting has multiple tag values, entities must match each of them.
      --silence-events        disable printing events to stdout
      --skip-consumers        do not diff consumers or any plugins associated with consumers
  -s, --state strings         file(s) containing Kong's configuration.
                              This flag can be specified multiple times for multiple files.
                              Use '-' to read from stdin. (default [kong.yaml])
  -w, --workspace string      Diff configuration with a specific workspace (Kong Enterprise only).
                              This takes precedence over _workspace fields in state files.
