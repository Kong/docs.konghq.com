title: deck konnect diff
---

The konnect diff command is similar to a dry run of the 'deck konnect sync' command.

	It loads entities from Konnect and performs a diff with
	the entities in local files. This allows you to see the entities
	that will be created, updated, or deleted.

WARNING: This command is currently in alpha state. This command
might have breaking changes in future releases.
