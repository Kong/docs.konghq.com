title: deck validate
---

The validate command reads the state file and ensures validity.

It reads all the specified state files and reports YAML/JSON
parsing issues. It also checks for foreign relationships
and alerts if there are broken relationships, or missing links present.
No communication takes places between decK and Kong during the execution of
this command.


```
