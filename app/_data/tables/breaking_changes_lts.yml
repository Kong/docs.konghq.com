      Plugin batch queuing: **HTTP Log, StatsD, OpenTelemetry, and Datadog plugins**
      
      The queuing system has been reworked, causing some plugin parameters to not function as expected anymore.
    action: | 
      If you use queues in these plugins, new parameters must be configured. 
      See each plugin's documentation for details.

      The module `kong.tools.batch_queue` has been renamed to `kong.tools.batch` and the API was changed. 
      If your custom plugin uses queues, it must be updated to use the new parameters.

      > _Applies to 3.4.3.5 and later versions._

      In OpenSSL 3.2, the default SSL/TLS security level has been changed from 1 to 2.

      This means the security level is set to 112 bits of security. 
      As a result, the following are prohibited:
      * RSA, DSA, and DH keys shorter than 2048 bits
      * ECC keys shorter than 224 bits
      * Any cipher suite using RC4
      * SSL version 3
      Additionally, compression is disabled.

      The normalization rules for `route.path` have changed. 
      Kong Gateway now stores the unnormalized path, but the regex path always pattern-matches 
      with the normalized URI.
      
      Previously, Kong Gateway replaced percent-encoding in the regex path pattern to
       ensure different forms of URI matches. That is no longer supported. 
       Except for the reserved characters defined in [RFC 3986](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986), 
       write all other characters without percent-encoding. 
    action: |
      After the upgrade, if you configure routes using the old method, 
      you will receive an alert and need to reconfigure the affected routes using the new route 
      configuration method.

    description: |
      Kong Gateway no longer uses a heuristic to guess whether a route path is a regex pattern. 
      From 3.0 onward, all regex paths must start with the `~` prefix, and all paths that don't start with `~` are
      considered plain text. 
    action: |
      No manual migration required.       
      The migration process should automatically convert the regex paths when upgrading from 2.8 to 3.4. 

      Going forward, when writing a regex, it must start with the `~` symbol.

      Updated the priority for some plugins.

      This is important for those who run custom plugins as it may affect the sequence in which your plugins are executed.
      This does not change the order of execution for plugins in a standard Kong Gateway installation.

      Old and new plugin priority values:

      The `lua-resty-session` library has been upgraded to v4.0.0. This version includes a full 
      rewrite of the session library, and is not backwards compatible.

      This library is used by the following plugins: Session, OpenID Connect, and SAML. 
      Many session parameters used by these plugins have been renamed or removed. 

      This also affects any session configuration that uses the Session or OpenID Connect 
      plugin in the background, including sessions for Kong Manager and Dev Portal.

    action: |
      All existing sessions are invalidated when upgrading to this version. 
      For sessions to work as expected in this version, all nodes must run Kong Gateway 3.4.x.

      For that reason, we recommend that during upgrades, proxy nodes with mixed versions run for as little time as possible. 
      During that time, the invalid sessions could cause failures and partial downtime.

      You can expect the following behavior:
      * **After upgrading the control plane**: Existing Kong Manager and Dev Portal sessions will be 
      invalidated and all users will be required to log back in.
      * **After upgrading the data planes**: Existing proxy sessions will be invalidated. 
      If you have an IdP configured, users will be required to log back into the IdP.

      **After you have upgraded** all of your CP and DP nodes to 3.4 and ensured that your environment is stable, 
      you can update parameters to their new renamed versions. Although your configuration will continue to work as 
      previously configured, we recommend adjusting your configuration to avoid future unexpected behavior.
     
      See the [breaking changes doc](/gateway/latest/breaking-changes/32x/) for all session configuration 
      changes and guidance on how to convert your existing session configuration.

      Regex look-around and backreferences support in the atc-router have been removed. 
      These are rarely used features and removing support for them improves the speed of our regex matching.

      If your current regexes use look-around or backreferences you will receive an error when attempting to start Kong, 
      showing exactly what regex is incompatible. 
      
    action: |
      To ensure consistency of behavior after the upgrade, set `router_flavor = traditional`, 
      or change the regex to remove look-around or backreferences.

      **Prometheus plugin**
      
      Complete overhaul of the plugin:

      * High cardinality metrics are now disabled by default.
      * Decreased performance penalty to proxy traffic when collecting metrics.
      * The following metric names were adjusted to add units to standardize where possible:
        * `http_status` to `http_requests_total`.
        * `latency` to `kong_request_latency_ms` (HTTP), `kong_upstream_latency_ms`, `kong_kong_latency_ms`, and `session_duration_ms` (stream).

            Kong latency and upstream latency can operate at orders of different magnitudes. Separate these buckets to reduce memory overhead.

        * `kong_bandwidth` to `kong_bandwidth_bytes`.
        * `nginx_http_current_connections` and `nginx_stream_current_connections` were merged into to `nginx_hconnections_total`
        *  `request_count` and `consumer_status` were merged into http_requests_total.

            If the `per_consumer` config is set to `false`, the `consumer` label will be empty. If the `per_consumer` config is `true`, the `consumer` label will be filled.
            
      * Removed the following metric: `http_consumer_status`
      * New metrics:
        * `session_duration_ms`: monitoring stream connections.
        * `node_info`: Single gauge set to 1 that outputs the node's ID and Kong Gateway version.

      * `http_requests_total` has a new label, `source`. It can be set to `exit`, `error`, or `service`.
      * All memory metrics have a new label: `node_id`.
      * Updated the Grafana dashboard that comes packaged with Kong

      The default PostgreSQL SSL version has been bumped to TLS 1.2. In `kong.conf`:
   
      * The default [`pg_ssl_version`](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#postgres-settings)
      is now `tlsv1_2`.
      * Constrained the valid values of this configuration option to only accept the following: `tlsv1_1`, `tlsv1_2`, `tlsv1_3` or `any`.

      This mirrors the setting `ssl_min_protocol_version` in PostgreSQL 12.x and onward. 
      See the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/ssl_min_protocol_version/)
      for more information about that parameter.
  
    action: |
      Change the value in your `kong.conf` or environment variables from `tlsv1_0` to `tlsv1_2`.

      To use the default setting in `kong.conf`, verify that your Postgres server supports TLS 1.2 or higher versions, or set the TLS version yourself. 
      TLS versions lower than `tlsv1_2` are already deprecated and considered insecure from PostgreSQL 12.x onward.

      The `/consumer_groups/:id/overrides` endpoint is deprecated in favor of a more generic plugin scoping mechanism. 

    action: |
      Instead of setting overrides, you can apply a plugin instance to a consumer group entity. See the 
      [Rate Limiting Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced/how-to/)
      documentation for an example.

      As of 3.0, Kong Gateway's schema library's `process_auto_fields` function will not make deep copies of data that is passed to it when the given context is `select`.
      This was done to avoid excessive deep copying of tables where we believe the data most of the time comes from a driver like `pgmoon` or `lmdb`.

      If a custom plugin relied on `process_auto_fields` not overriding the given table, it must make its own copy before passing it to the function now. 

    action: |
      If a custom plugin needs to fetch data by deep copying, perform it on the `select` context before calling the function. 
      
      Define `context = “select”` to trigger deep copying:

      ```lua
      local is_select = context == "select"
        if not is_select then
          data = tablex.deepcopy(data)
        end
      ```

      The list of reported plugins available on the server now returns a table of 
      metadata per plugin instead of the boolean `true`. 

      For example:
      
      ```json
      plugins": {
        "available_on_server": {
            "acl": "3.0.1",
            "acme": "0.4.0",
            "aws-lambda": "3.6.3",
            "azure-functions": "1.0.1",
            "basic-auth": "2.2.0",
            "bot-detection": "2.0.0",
        ...
      ```
    action: |
      Adapt to use the new metadata instead of boolean values.

      PostgreSQL migrations can now have an `up_f` part like Cassandra migrations, designating a function to call. 
      The `up_f` part is invoked after the `up` part has been executed against the database.

  #     The `traditional_compat` router mode has been made more compatible with the behavior of traditional mode by splitting 
  #     routes with multiple paths into multiple atc routes with separate priorities. 
      
  #     Since the introduction of the new router in Kong Gateway 3.0, traditional_compat mode assigned only one priority to each route, even if different prefix path lengths and regular expressions were mixed in a route. 
  #     This was not how multiple paths were handled in the traditional router and the behavior has now been changed so that a separate priority value is assigned to each path in a route.

      **HTTP Log plugin** 
      
      If the log server responds with a 3xx HTTP status code, the plugin now considers it to be 
      an error and retries according to the retry configuration. Previously, 3xx status codes would be interpreted 
      as a success, causing the log entries to be dropped.
