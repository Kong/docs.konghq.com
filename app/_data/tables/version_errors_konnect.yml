      For the `openid-connect` plugin, one or more of the following
      `login_redirect_uri`, `logout_redirect_uri` and `scopes` fields are set in a
      reference format, but only Kong Gateways falling in the following version ranges
      support reference formats for these fields: versions >= 3.4.3.2 and < 3.5.0.0;
      versions >= 3.5.0.2. These fields have not been modified and will fail
      validation in the data plane. Plugin features that rely on these fields are not
      working as intended.
    Resolution: |
      Please upgrade Kong Gateway or remove fields using reference values.
      Alternatively, update fields using reference values to instead use explicit
      values.

      For one or more of the following plugins `acme`, rate-limiting`, and
      `response-ratelimiting`, instance(s) have been configured with both redis-ce
      partial(s) and old redis fields. These two sets of redis fields have conflicting

      configuration to use the new fields.
