      - name: HashiCorp Vault CA
        tooltip: |
          Allows you to enable HashiCorp Vault as an additional third-party backend for mTLS CAs that are used to setup zero-trust security, without storing the CAs in Kong Mesh proper.

      - name: GUI Dashboard for TLS and CA
        tooltip: |
          Provides you with additional visual reports that display the rotation status of the data plane proxy certificates and the rotation of the CAs themselves, in a zero-trust service mesh.

        kuma: true
        mesh: true
      - name: CA Automatic Rotation
        tooltip: |
          Provides automatic rotation across different CAs with no downtime in addition to providing automatic rotation and certificate lifecycle management to the data plane proxy mTLS certificates. This feature combined with the GUI Dashboard for TLS and CA provides a complete solution for managing the entire lifecycle of zero-trust service meshes.

  - name: Enterprise Application Security
    items:
      - name: FIPS-140 Encryption
        tooltip: |
          By default, FIPS-140 compliant encryption is automatically enabled in Kong Mesh on the Envoy-based data plane proxies. This doesn't require any additional steps other than running Kong Mesh itself.
        kuma: false
        mesh: true
      - name: Embedded OPA Agent
        tooltip: |
          Kong Mesh ships with an embedded OPA agent in the data plane proxy sidecars, without requiring the user to run an additional dedicated sidecar for the OPA agent. This simplifies the roll out of OPA across the entire organization and lowers operational costs.
        kuma: false
        mesh: true
      - name: Native OPA Policy
        tooltip: |
          This exposes a native OPA policy resource that can be used to store and automatically propagate OPA policies across a multi-zone deployment natively with Kong Mesh. We also support the ability to connect to a third-party OPA store like Styra.

  - name: Enterprise Security and Governance
    items:
      - name: Roles and permissions (RBAC)
        tooltip: |
          Allows you to manage complex RBAC rules to allow or deny access to Kong Mesh policies and functions in a sophisticated and fine grained way. This works across multi-zone and multi-mesh natively.
        kuma: false
        mesh: true
      - name: Audit Logs
        tooltip: |
          Allows you to store and fetch auditing logs for operations that were performed on the cluster. When used with RBAC, it allows us to have full visibility into how the system is being governed and configured by the users.
