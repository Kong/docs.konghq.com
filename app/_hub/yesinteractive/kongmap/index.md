## Features

#### Cluster View
Allows an admin to view a dynamic map of their Kong API Gateway clusters and visually see relationships between
Workspaces (for Kong Enterprise), Services, Routes (Endpoints), and Plugins (Policies). Clicking on any entity displays
details of the entity and related links. Plugins can be toggled from view.

#### Endpoint Analyzer
View details of an API Endpoint (Route). The analyzer shows the Service attached to the endpoint/route as well as 
a breakdown of all plugins/policies in order of execution attached to the route/endpoint. For Kong Enterprise users,
all entities can be viewed directly via a link to Kong Manager.

#### Declarative Configuration Viewer/Editor
KongMap is deployed with a browser-based version of Kong's CLI tool, decK. Here you can view, edit, and export Kong declarative configurations for your open source 
and Enterprise clusters via YAML. Declarative
configuration editing can be disabled by KongMap configuration, or managed with RBAC permissions if using Kong Enterprise.

## Compatibility ## 
KongMap supports both Kong Open Source and Kong Enterprise Clusters greater than version 1.3 and supports both DB and Non-DB (dbless) Kong configurations. KongMap also supports Kong for Kubernetes Ingress Controller versions greater than 0.5 (In Kong for Kubernetes, the Ingress Controller's proxy container must have its Admin API exposed in some fashion.)

## Docker Installation ##

Docker image is Alpine 3.11 based running PHP 7.3 on Apache. The container exposes both ports 80 an 443 with a self-signed certificated. 

#### 1. Export Cluster Configurations to Variable ####

The connections to your Kong clusters are defined using JSON. The below example illustrates adding two Kong clusters to KongMap:

```json
{
  "my enterprise cluster": {
    "kong_admin_api_url": "http://kongapi_url:8001",
    "kong_edit_config": "true",
    "kong_ent": "true",
    "kong_ent_token": "admin",
    "kong_ent_token_name": "kong-admin-token",
    "kong_ent_manager_url": "http://kongmanager_url:8002"
  },
  "my kong open source cluster": {
    "kong_admin_api_url": "http://kongapi_url:8001",
    "kong_edit_config": "true",
    "kong_ent": "false",
    "kong_ent_token": "null",
    "kong_ent_token_name": "null",
    "kong_ent_manager_url": "null"
  }
}
  ```

Notice the `kong_ent` configurations. Enable and configure this if the cluster you are configuring is Kong Cluster. If you do not, only the Default workspace
will be visible in your Kong Enterprise Cluster.

Export the config to a variable:

```shell
 export KONG_CLUSTERS='{  "my enterprise cluster": {    "kong_admin_api_url": "http://kongapi_url:8001",    "kong_edit_config": "true",   "kong_ent": "true",    "kong_ent_token": "admin",    "kong_ent_token_name": "kong-admin-token",    "kong_ent_manager_url": "http://kongmanager_url:8002"  }}'
  ```

#### 2. Start Container ####

Run the container with the following command. Set the ports to your preferred exposed ports. The example below exposes KongMap on ports 8100 and 8143. Notice the `KONGMAP_URL` variable. Set this optional variable if you have a need to set all KongMap URL's to a specific domain or URL.

```
$ docker run -d \
  -e "KONGMAP_CLUSTERS_JSON=$KONG_CLUSTERS" \
  -e "KONGMAP_URL=http://url_to_kongmap:8100" \
  -p 8100:80 \
  -p 8143:443 \
  yesinteractive/kongmap
```

#### 3. Authentication ####

If you want to enable authentication to KongMap's UI, it is recommended to run Kongmap behind your Kong Gateway and implement any authentication
policies you feel are appropriate (OIDC, OAUTH2, Basic Auth, etc.) at the gateway.
