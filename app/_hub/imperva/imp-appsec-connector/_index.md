The Imperva API Security plugin connects Kong Gateway with the Imperva 
API Security service, providing continuous discovery and monitoring of APIs 
exposed by the API gateway. This enables security teams to protect business 
applications and data against unauthorized access. 

The plugin operates with a very low CPU and memory footprint, avoiding any 
negative impact on the inline performance of the gateway or your applications.

The Imperva API Security plugin captures API calls with request/response payloads 
and sends them to the Imperva API Security service for inspection. API calls are 
copied and streamed through Kong Gateway. You provide the API Security 
receiver service endpoint though the plugin's configuration, so the API data is 
kept under the control of the application owner.

## How it works
The plugin sends a copy of API call requests/responses to the Imperva API receiver. The receiver service destination address and port are specified as config parameters. Additional parameters are used to control how the API captures are sent. 

## How to install

{:.note}
> If you are using Kong's [Kubernetes ingress controller](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller), the installation is slightly different. Review the [docs for the Kong Ingress Controller](/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/setting-up-custom-plugins/).

The `.rock` file is a self-contained package that can be installed locally or from a remote server.

If the LuaRocks utility is installed in your system (this is likely the case if you used one of the official installation packages), you can install the `rock` in your LuaRocks tree, that is, the directory in which LuaRocks installs Lua modules.

### Install the Imperva Plugin

```shell
 luarocks install imp-appsec-connector
```

### Update your loaded plugins list
In your `kong.conf`, append `imp-appsec-connector` to the `plugins` field. Make sure the field is not commented out.

```yaml
plugins = bundled,imp-appsec-connector         # Comma-separated list of plugins this node
                                	       # should load. By default, only plugins
                                               # bundled in official distributions are
                                               # loaded via the `bundled` keyword.
```


### Restart Kong

After LuaRocks is installed, restart Kong before enabling the plugin:

```shell
kong restart
```
