desc: Integrate Kong Gateway with Imperva API Security to discover, monitor, and protect APIs
description: |
  The Imperva API Security plugin connects Kong Gateway with the Imperva 
  API Security service, providing continuous discovery and monitoring of APIs 
  exposed by the API gateway. This enables security teams to protect business 
  applications and data against unauthorized access. 
  
  The plugin operates with a very low CPU and memory footprint, avoiding any 
  negative impact on the inline performance of the gateway or your applications.
  
  The Imperva API Security plugin captures API calls with request/response payloads 
  and sends them to the Imperva API Security service for inspection. API calls are 
  copied and streamed through Kong Gateway. You provide the API Security 
  receiver service endpoint though the plugin's configuration, so the API data is 
  kept under the control of the application owner.
