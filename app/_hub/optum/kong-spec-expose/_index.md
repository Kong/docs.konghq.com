This plugin will expose the OpenAPI Spec (OAS), Swagger, or other specification of auth protected API services fronted by the Kong gateway.

API providers need a means of exposing the specifications of their services while maintaining authentication on the service itself - this plugin solves this problem by:

1. Plugin enables Kong Admin to specify the endpoint of their API specification.

2. Plugin will validate the Proxy request is GET method, and will validate the proxy request ends with "/specz". If these two requirements are met, the endpoint will return the specification of the API Service with Content-Type header identical to what the API Service exposes.
