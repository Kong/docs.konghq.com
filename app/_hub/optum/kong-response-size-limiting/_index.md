Block upstream responses whose body is greater than a specific size in megabytes.

Proxy consumers will receive an HTTP Status of 413 and message body "Response size limit exceeded" in the event the body is greater than configured size.

## Caveat
This plugin currently accomplishes response limiting by validating the Content-Length header on upstream responses.
If the upstream lacks the response header, then this plugin will allow the response to pass.

## Installation
Recommended:

```bash
$ luarocks install kong-response-size-limiting
```
