The DataDome plugin is developed in Lua and integrates smoothly with Kong.

This plugin will analyse in real time any API requests received. For each request, an api call is sent to DataDome Bot & Fraud Protection Platform to validate if this is legitimate or not.
The only thing to configure is your DataDome Server Side Key.

[This integration guide](https://docs.datadome.co/docs/kong-plugin) describes how to integrate DataDome with Kong API Gateway.
