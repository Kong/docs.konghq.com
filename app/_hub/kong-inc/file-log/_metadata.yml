desc: Append request and response data to a log file
description: |
  Append request and response data in JSON format to a log file. You can also specify
  streams (for example, `/dev/stdout` and `/dev/stderr`), which is especially useful
  when running Kong in Kubernetes.

  This plugin uses blocking I/O, which could affect performance when writing
  to physical files on slow (spinning) disks.
