You can use the Injection Protection plugin to detect well known patterns that might be the result of a cross site scripting or other injection type attacks.

The Injection Protection plugin makes it easier to protect your ? from cross site scription or other injection attacks by providing out-of-the box regex matching for common injection attacks. In addition, you can configure custom regex matching as well. 

The Injection Protection plugin does the following: 
* Extracts information from request headers, path/query parameters, or the payload body and evaluate that content against pre-defined regular expression
* Rejects the requests that match the regular expressions with a 400 bad request
* Captures metrics about rejected requests for analytics and reporting
