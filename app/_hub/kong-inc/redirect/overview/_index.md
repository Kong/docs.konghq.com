The Redirect plugin allows you to stop request execution and return a `Location` header to the caller to redirect them to a new URL.

You can keep the incoming request URL while redirecting to a new host or port by setting `keep_incoming_path` to `true`.

## Get started with the Redirect plugin

* [Configuration reference](/hub/kong-inc/redirect/configuration/)
