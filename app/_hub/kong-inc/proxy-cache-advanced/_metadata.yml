  > **Warning:** The `content_type` parameter requires
  an exact match. For example, if your upstream expects
  `application/json; charset=utf-8` and the
  `config.content_type` value is only `application/json`
  (a partial match), then the proxy cache is bypassed.

desc: Cache and serve commonly requested responses in Kong
description: |
  This plugin provides a reverse proxy cache implementation for Kong. It caches
  response entities based on configurable response code and content type, as well
  as request method. It can cache per-Consumer or per-API. Cache entities are stored
  for a configurable period of time, after which subsequent requests to the same
  resource will re-fetch and re-store the resource. Cache entities can also be
  forcefully purged via the Admin API prior to their expiration time.
