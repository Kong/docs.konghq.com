_NOTE_: The advanced label is only attached because this is an Enterprise-only
plugin. There is no corresponding community plugin version available.

## Synopsis

This plugin transforms the routing on the fly in Kong, changing the upstream server/port/path to hit. The substitutions can be configured via flexible templates.

## Template as value

The templates that can be used as values are the same as the [request-transformer](/hub/kong-inc/request-transformer-advanced/).
