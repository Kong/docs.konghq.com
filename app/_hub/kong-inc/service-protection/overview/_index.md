Set absolute maximum rate limits for services using the Service Protection plugin. 
You can use this plugin together with other rate limiting plugins to apply granular rate limits based on different entities.

If you want to apply global rate limits or apply rate limits to routes and consumers, see the following other rate limiting plugins:

The Service Protection plugin uses the same [Rate Limiting Library](/gateway/latest/reference/rate-limiting/) as the other rate limiting plugins.

## FAQs

<details><summary>Does the Service Protection plugin replace the Rate Limiting or Rate Limiting Advanced plugins?</summary>

{% capture rl_plugins_replace %}
No. The Service Protection plugin only rate limits services. You can still use the Rate Limiting and Rate Limiting Advanced 
plugins to rate limit other entities, like consumers and routes.

<details><summary>Can I use the Service Protection plugin with other rate limiting plugins?</summary>

{% capture rl_plugins_compatibility %} 
Yes. You can rate limit a service with the Service Protection plugin, then rate limit routes, consumers, or consumer groups
with the other rate limiting plugins. 

{:.note}
> **Note:** We donâ€™t recommend using multiple rate limiting plugins on the same **service only**.
We recommend applying Service Protection on the service, and Rate Limiting (or Rate Limiting Advanced) on the service/consumer pair, for more granular rate limits.
