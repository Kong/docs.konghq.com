## Example Use Cases

- Temporarily disable a Service (e.g. it is under maintenance).
- Temporarily disable a Route (e.g. the rest of the Service is up and running, but a particular endpoint must be disabled).
- Temporarily disable a Consumer (e.g. excessive consumption).
- Block anonymous access with multiple auth plugins in a logical `OR` setup.
