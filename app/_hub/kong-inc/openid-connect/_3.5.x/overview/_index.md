The OpenID Connect ([1.0](http://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html)) plugin 
(also known as OIDC) allows for integration with a third party
identity provider (IdP) in a standardized way. This plugin can be used to implement
Kong as a (proxying) [OAuth 2.0](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) resource server 
(RS) and/or as an OpenID Connect relying party (RP) between the client and the upstream service.

The plugin supports several types of credentials and grants, and has been tested with several 
OpenID Connect providers.
Review the [support reference](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/support/) to see all of them.

## About OpenID Connect

### What does OpenID Connect do?

OpenID Connect provides a way to form a **federation** with **identity providers (IdPs)**. 
Identity providers are third parties that store account credentials. 
If the identity provider authenticates a user, the application trusts that provider and allows access to the user. 
The identity provider bears some responsibility for protecting the user’s credentials and ensuring authenticity, 
so applications no longer need to on their own.

Besides delegating responsibility to an identity provider, OpenID Connect also makes single sign-on possible 
without storing any credentials on a user’s local machine.

Finally, enterprises may want to manage access control for many applications from one central system of record. 
For example, they may want employees to be able to access many different applications using their email address and password. 
They may want to also change access (for example, if an employee leaves or changes roles) from one central point. 
OpenID Connect addresses this challenge by providing a way for many different applications to authenticate users through the 
same third-party identity provider.

### What does Kong’s OpenID Connect plugin do?

Just as OpenID Connect enables developers to offload authentication to another party, Kong enables developers to 
separate entire processes from their applications. Rather than needing to hand write the code for OpenID Connect 
*within* a service, developers can place Kong in front of the service and have Kong handle authentication. 
This separation allows developers to focus on the business logic within their application. 
It also allows them to easily swap out services while preserving authentication at the front door, and 
to effortlessly spread the same authentication to *new* services.

Kong users may prefer OpenID Connect to other authentication types, such as Key Auth and Basic Auth, 
because they will not need to manage the database storing passwords. Instead, they can offload the 
task to a trusted identity provider of their choice.

While the OpenID Connect plugin can suit many different use cases and extends to other plugins 
such as JWT (JSON Web Token) and 0Auth 2.0, the most common use case is the 
[authorization code flow](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/authorization-code-flow/).

## How-to guides and demos

{% include_cached /md/plugins-hub/oidc-prod-note.md %}

We recommend reviewing the [important configuration parameters](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/primary-config-params/) 
before implementing any flows or grants.

### Authentication flows and grants

We use [HTTPie](https://httpie.org/) to execute the examples. The output is stripped
for better readability. [httpbin.org](https://httpbin.org/) is used as an upstream service.

Using the Admin API is convenient when testing the plugin, but you can set up similar configs 
in declarative format as well.

When this plugin is configured with multiple grants/flows, there is a hardcoded search
order for the credentials:

1. [Session Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/session/)
2. [JWT Access Token Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/jwt-access-token/)
3. [Kong OAuth Token Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/kong-oauth-token/)
4. [Introspection Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/introspection/)
5. [User Info Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/user-info/)
6. [Refresh Token Grant](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/refresh-token)
7. [Password Grant](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/password-grant/)
8. [Client Credentials Grant](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/client-credentials/)
9. [Authorization Code Flow](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authentication/authorization-code-flow/)

Once credentials are found, the plugin will stop searching further. Multiple grants may
share the same credentials. For example, both the password and client credentials grants can use 
basic access authentication through the `Authorization` header.

### Authorization

The OpenID Connect plugin has several features to do coarse grained authorization:

1. [Claims based authorization](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authorization/claims/)
2. [ACL plugin authorization](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authorization/acl/)
3. [Consumer authorization](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/authorization/consumer/)

### OIDC authentication in Kong Manager

{{site.base_gateway}} can use OpenID Connect to secure Kong Manager.
It offers the ability to bind authentication for Kong
Manager admins to an organization's OpenID Connect Identity
Provider, using the OpenID Connect plugin in the background.

You don't need to set up the plugin directly. 
Instead, {{site.base_gateway}} accesses the OIDC plugin through settings in `kong.conf`.

To set up RBAC in Kong Manager with OIDC, see:

* [Enable OIDC for Kong Manager](/gateway/latest/kong-manager/auth/oidc/configure/)
* [OIDC Authenticated Group Mapping](/gateway/latest/kong-manager/auth/oidc/mapping/)

{% if_plugin_version lte:3.4.x %}
### OIDC authentication in Dev Portal

The OpenID Connect plugin allows the Kong Dev Portal to hook into existing authentication 
setups using third-party identity providers such as Google, Okta, Microsoft Azure AD, Curity,
and so on.

OIDC must be used with the `session` method, utilizing cookies for Dev Portal File API requests.

You don't need to set up the plugin directly. 
Instead, {{site.base_gateway}} accesses the OIDC plugin through settings in `kong.conf`, or from {{site.konnect_short_name}}.

{{site.konnect_short_name}}:
* [Configure Azure IdP for Dev Portal](/konnect/dev-portal/access-and-approval/azure/)
* [Single sign-on](/konnect/dev-portal/customization/#single-sign-on)

Self-managed {{site.base_gateway}}:
* [Enable OpenID Connect in the Dev Portal](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/oidc/)
* [OIDC with Curity for Dev Portal](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/how-to/third-party/curity/#kong-dev-portal-authentication)

#### Application registration

You can also use OIDC for application registration in Dev Portal.

Application registration in {{site.konnect_short_name}}:
* [Configure Auth0 for Dynamic Client Registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dynamic-client-registration/auth0/)
* [Configure Curity for Dynamic Client Registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dynamic-client-registration/curity/)
* [Configure Okta for Dynamic Client Registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/dynamic-client-registration/okta/)

Application registration in self-managed {{site.base_gateway}}:
* [Application Registration plugin](/hub/kong-inc/application-registration/)
* [Third-party OAuth2 Support for Application Registration](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/3rd-party-oauth/)
* [External Portal Application Authentication with Azure AD and OIDC](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/azure-oidc-config/)
* [Set Up External Portal Application Authentication with Okta and OIDC](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/okta-config/)
