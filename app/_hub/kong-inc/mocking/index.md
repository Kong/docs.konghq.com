desc: Provide mock endpoints to test your APIs against your services

  Mock your services.
  This plugins reads the API specification file loaded from the Kong DB and presents
  with response extracted from examples provided in the specification. Swagger v2 and OpenAPI
  v3 specifications are supported.

  Benefits of service mocking:

  - Accelerates development of services and APIs.
  - Promotes parallel development of APIs across distributed teams.
  - Provides an enhanced full lifecycle API development experience with Dev Portal integration.

  <div class="alert alert-ee blue"><strong>Note:</strong> The Mocking plugin is compatible with
  the Kong Gateway (Enterprise) beta version 2.4.x.
