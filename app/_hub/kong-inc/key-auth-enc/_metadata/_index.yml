notes: |
  This plugin is not available in Konnect, and has limitations in hybrid mode:
  - Konnect automatically encrypts key authentication credentials at rest, so 
  encryption via this plugin is not necessary. 
  Use the regular [Key Auth](/hub/kong-inc/key-auth/) plugin instead.
  - The time-to-live (ttl) does not work in hybrid mode. This setting
  determines the length of time a credential remains valid.
