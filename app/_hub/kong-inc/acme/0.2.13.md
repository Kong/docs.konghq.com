    `config.storage_config` is a table for all possible storage types. By default, it is:
    ```json
        "storage_config": {
          "kong": {},
          "shm": {
            "shm_name": "kong"
          },
          "redis": {
            "auth": null,
            "port": 6379,
            "database": 0,
            "host": "127.0.0.1"
          },
           "consul": {
              "host": "127.0.0.1",
              "port": 8500,
              "token": null,
              "kv_path": "acme",
              "timeout": 2000,
              "https": false
          },
          "vault": {
              "host": "127.0.0.1",

              "tls_server_name": null
          },
        }
    ```

    To configure a storage type other than `kong`, refer to [lua-resty-acme](https://github.com/fffonion/lua-resty-acme#storage-adapters).

    External account binding (EAB) is supported as long as `eab_kid` and `eab_hmac_key` are provided.

    The following CA provider's external account can be registered automatically, without specifying
    the `eab_kid` or `eab_hmac_key`:

### Workflow

A `http-01` challenge workflow between the Kong Gateway and the ACME server is described below:

1. The client sends a proxy or Admin API request that triggers certificate generation for `mydomain.com`.
2. The Kong Gateway sends a request to the ACME server to start the validation process.
3. The ACME server returns a challenge response detail to the Kong Gateway.
4. `mydomain.com` is publicly resolvable to the Kong Gateway that serves the challenge response.
5. The ACME server checks if the previous challenge has a response at `mydomain.com`.
6. The Kong Gateway checks the challenge status and if passed, downloads the certificate from the ACME server.
7. The Kong Gateway uses the new certificate to serve TLS requests.

### Using the Plugin

#### Configure Kong

- Kong needs to listen on port 80 or proxy a load balancer that listens for port 80.
- `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` needs to be set in `kong.conf` to ensure the plugin can properly
verify the Let's Encrypt API. The CA-bundle file is usually `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` for
Ubuntu/Debian and `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt` for CentOS/Fedora/RHEL. Starting with Kong v2.2,
users can set this config to `system` to auto pick CA-bundle from OS.

#### Configure Plugin

Here's a sample declarative configuration with `redis` as storage:

```yaml
_format_version: "1.1"
# this section is not necessary if there's already a route that matches
# /.well-known/acme-challenge path with http protocol
services:
  - name: acme-dummy
    url: http://127.0.0.1:65535
    routes:
      - name: acme-dummy
        protocols:
          - http
        paths:
          - /.well-known/acme-challenge
plugins:
  - name: acme
    config:
      account_email: example@myexample.com
      domains:
        - "*.example.com"
        - "example.com"
      tos_accepted: true
      storage: redis
      storage_config:
        redis:
          host: redis.service
          port: 6379
```

#### Enable the Plugin

For each the domain that needs a certificate, make sure `DOMAIN/.well-known/acme-challenge`
is mapped to a Route in Kong. You can check this by sending
`curl KONG_IP/.well-known/acme-challenge/x -H "host:DOMAIN"` and getting the response `Not found`.
You can also [use the Admin API](#create-certificates) to verify the setup.
If not, add a Route and a dummy Service to catch this route.

```bash
# add a dummy service if needed
$ curl http://localhost:8001/services \
        -d name=acme-dummy \
        -d url=http://127.0.0.1:65535

# add a dummy route if needed
$ curl http://localhost:8001/routes \
        -d name=acme-dummy \
        -d paths[]=/.well-known/acme-challenge \
        -d service.name=acme-dummy

# add the plugin
$ curl http://localhost:8001/plugins \
        -d name=acme \
        -d config.account_email=yourname@yourdomain.com \
        -d config.tos_accepted=true \
        -d config.domains[]=my.secret.domains.com
```

Note by setting `tos_accepted` to *true* implies that you have read and accepted
[terms of service](https://letsencrypt.org/repository/).

**This plugin can only be configured as a global plugin.** The plugin terminates
`/.well-known/acme-challenge/` path for matching domains. To create certificates
and terminate challenges only for certain domains, refer to the
[Parameters](#parameters) section.

#### Trigger creation of certificate

Assume Kong proxy is accessible via http://mydomain.com and https://mydomain.com.

```bash
# Trigger asynchronous creation from proxy requests
# The following request returns immediately with Kong's default certificate
# Wait up to 1 minute for the background process to finish
$ curl https://mydomain.com -k

# OR create from Admin API synchronously
# User can also use this endpoint to force "renew" a certificate
$ curl http://localhost:8001/acme -d host=mydomain.com

# Furthermore, it's possible to run a sanity test on your Kong setup
# before creating any certificate
$ curl http://localhost:8001/acme -d host=mydomain.com -d test_http_challenge_flow=true

$ curl https://mydomain.com
# Now gives you a valid Let's Encrypt certicate
```

#### Renew certificates

The plugin runs daily checks and automatically renews all certificates that
will expire in less than the configured `renew_threshold_days` value. If the renewal
of an individual certificate throws an error, the plugin will continue renewing the
other certificates. It will try renewing all certificates, including those that previously
failed, once per day. Note the renewal configuration is stored in the configured storage backend.
If the storage is cleared or modified outside of Kong, renewal might not complete properly.

It's also possible to actively trigger the renewal. The following request
schedules a renewal in the background and returns immediately.

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8001/acme -XPATCH
```

### Local testing and development

#### Run ngrok

[ngrok](https://ngrok.com) exposes a local URL to the internet. [Download ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) and install.

*`ngrok` is only needed for local testing or development, it's **not** a requirement for the plugin itself.*

Run ngrok with

```bash
$ ./ngrok http localhost:8000
# Shows something like
# ...
# Forwarding                    http://e2e034a5.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
# Forwarding                    https://e2e034a5.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:8000
# ...
# Substitute "e2e034a5.ngrok.io" with the host shows in your ngrok output
$ export NGROK_HOST=e2e034a5.ngrok.io
```

Leave the process running.

#### Configure Route and Service

```bash
$ curl http://localhost:8001/services -d name=acme-test -d url=http://mockbin.org
$ curl http://localhost:8001/routes -d service.name=acme-test -d hosts=$NGROK_HOST
```

#### Enable Plugin

```bash
$ curl localhost:8001/plugins -d name=acme \
                                -d config.account_email=test@test.com \
                                -d config.tos_accepted=true \
                                -d config.domains[]=$NGROK_HOST
```

#### Trigger creation of certificate

```bash
$ curl https://$NGROK_HOST:8443 --resolve $NGROK_HOST:8443:127.0.0.1 -vk
# Wait for several seconds
```

#### Check new certificate

```bash
$ echo q |openssl s_client -connect localhost -port 8443 -servername $NGROK_HOST 2>/dev/null |openssl x509 -text -noout
```

### Notes

- In database mode, the plugin creates an SNI and Certificate entity in Kong to
serve the certificate. If SNI or Certificate for the current request is already set
in the database, they will be overwritten.
- In DB-less mode, the plugin takes over certificate handling. If the SNI or
Certificate entity is already defined in Kong, they will be overridden by the
response.
- The plugin only supports http-01 challenge, meaning a user will need a public
IP and set up a resolvable DNS. Kong also needs to accept proxy traffic from port `80`.
Also, note that a wildcard or star (*) certificate is not supported. Each domain will have its
own certificate.
