  **Notes**:
  * If the value contains a `,` (comma), then the comma-separated format for lists cannot be used. The array
  notation must be used instead.
  * The `X-Forwarded-*` fields are non-standard header fields written by Nginx to inform the upstream about
  client details and can't be overwritten by this plugin. If you need to overwrite these header fields, see the
  [post-function plugin in Serverless Functions](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/serverless-functions/).

desc: Use regular expressions, variables, and templates to transform requests
description: |
  The Request Transformer plugin for Kong allows simple transformation of requests
  before they reach the upstream server. These transformations can be simple substitutions
  or complex ones matching portions of incoming requests using regular expressions, saving
  those matched strings into variables, and substituting those strings into transformed requests using flexible templates.

  For additional request transformation features, check out the
  [Request Transformer Advanced plugin](/hub/kong-inc/request-transformer-advanced/).
  With the advanced plugin, you can also limit the list of allowed parameters in the request body.
