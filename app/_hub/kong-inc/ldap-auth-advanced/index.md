### Usage

In order to authenticate the user, client must set credentials in
`Proxy-Authorization` or `Authorization` header in following format:

credentials := [ldap | LDAP] base64(username:password)

The plugin will validate the user against the LDAP server and cache the
credential for future requests for the duration specified in
`config.cache_ttl`.

#### Upstream Headers

When a client has been authenticated, the plugin will append some headers to the
 request before proxying it to the upstream service, so that you can identify 
 the consumer in your code:

* `X-Credential-Username`, the `username` of the Credential (only if the 
consumer is not the 'anonymous' consumer)
* `X-Anonymous-Consumer`, will be set to `true` when authentication failed, and 
the 'anonymous' consumer was set instead.
* `X-Consumer-ID`, the ID of the 'anonymous' consumer on Kong (only if 
authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)
* `X-Consumer-Custom-ID`, the `custom_id` of the 'anonymous' consumer (only if 
authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)
* `X-Consumer-Username`, the `username` of the 'anonymous' consumer (only if 
authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)


#### LDAP Search and config.bind_dn

LDAP directory searching is performed during the request/plugin lifecycle. It is
used to retrieve the fully qualified DN of the user so a bind 
request can be performed with the user's given LDAP username and password. The 
search for the user being authenticated uses the `config.bind_dn` property. The 
search uses `scope="sub"`, `filter="<config.attribute>=<username>"`, and
`base_dn=<config.base_dn>`. Here is an example of how it performs the search 
using the `ldapsearch` command line utility:

```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -h "<config.ldap_host>" -D "<config.bind_dn>" -b 
"<config.attribute>=<username><config.base_dn>" -w "<config.ldap_password>"
```
