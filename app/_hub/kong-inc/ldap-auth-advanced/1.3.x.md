If `consumer_optional=false`, LDAP authenticated users can still access upstream resources. To prevent access from LDAP users that are not associated with consumers, set `consumer_optional=false`, set the `anonymous` field to an existing `consumer_id`, then use the Request Termination plugin to deny any requests from the anonymous consumer.

## Usage

To authenticate a user, the client must set credentials in either the
`Proxy-Authorization` or `Authorization` header in the following format:

    credentials := [ldap | LDAP] base64(username:password)

The Authorization header would look something like:

    Authorization:  ldap dGxibGVzc2luZzpLMG5nU3RyMG5n

The plugin validates the user against the LDAP server and caches the
credentials for future requests for the duration specified in
`config.cache_ttl`.

You can set the header type `ldap` to any string (such as `basic`) using
`config.header_type`.



### Upstream Headers

When a client has been authenticated, the plugin appends some headers to the
request before proxying it to the upstream service so that you can identify
the consumer in your code:

* `X-Credential-Username`, the `username` of the Credential (only if the
consumer is not the 'anonymous' consumer)
* `X-Anonymous-Consumer`, will be set to `true` when authentication failed, and
the 'anonymous' consumer was set instead.
* `X-Consumer-ID`, the ID of the 'anonymous' consumer on Kong (only if
authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)
* `X-Consumer-Custom-ID`, the `custom_id` of the 'anonymous' consumer (only if
authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)
* `X-Consumer-Username`, the `username` of the 'anonymous' consumer (only if
authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)


### LDAP Search and `config.bind_dn`

LDAP directory searching is performed during the request/plugin lifecycle. It is
used to retrieve the fully qualified DN of the user so a bind
request can be performed with a user's given LDAP username and password. The
search for the user being authenticated uses the `config.bind_dn` property. The
search uses `scope="sub"`, `filter="<config.attribute>=<username>"`, and
`base_dn=<config.base_dn>`. Here is an example of how it performs the search
using the `ldapsearch` command line utility:

```bash
$ ldapsearch -x -h "<config.ldap_host>" -D "<config.bind_dn>" -b
"<config.attribute>=<username><config.base_dn>" -w "<config.ldap_password>"
```
