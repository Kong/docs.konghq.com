title: Configure Streaming with AI Proxy

This guide walks you through setting up the AI Proxy plugin with streaming.

## How it works

Streaming is a mode where a client can specify `"stream": true` in their request and the LLM server will stream each piece of the response text (usually token-by-token) as a server-sent event.

Kong captures each batch of events and translates them back into the inference format, so that all providers are compatible with the same framework that you create on your side.

When streaming is disabled, requests proxy directly to the LLM look like this:

{% mermaid %}
flowchart LR
  A(client)
  B(Kong Gateway with 
  AI Proxy plugin)
  C(Cloud LLM)

  A --> B
  B --sends request 
  information--> C
  C --> A
{% endmermaid %}

When streaming is enabled, requests proxy directly to the LLM look like this:

{% mermaid %}
flowchart LR
  A(client)
  B(Kong Gateway with 
  AI Proxy plugin)
  C(Cloud LLM)
  D[[transform frame]]
  E[[read frame]]

subgraph main
direction LR
  subgraph 1
  A
  end
  subgraph 3
  C
  end
  subgraph 2
  D
  E
  end
  A --> B --request--> C
  C --response--> B
  B --> D-->E
  E --> B
  B --> A
end

  linkStyle 2,3,4,5,6 stroke:#b6d7a8,color:#b6d7a8
  style 1 color:#fff,stroke:#fff
  style 2 color:#fff,stroke:#fff
  style 3 color:#fff,stroke:#fff
  style main color:#fff,stroke:#fff
{% endmermaid %}

The new streaming framework captures each event, sends the chunk back to the client, and then exits early. 

It will also estimate tokens for LLM services that decided to not stream back the token use counts when the message completed.

## Streaming limitations

Keep the following limitations in mind when you configure streaming for the AI Proxy plugin: 

* Multiple AI features shouldnâ€™t expect to be applied and work simultaneously
* You cannot use the [Response Transformer plugin](/hub/kong-inc/response-transformer/) when streaming is configured.

## Configuration

### Prerequisites

### Set up streaming

### Test the configuration

Make an `llm/v1/chat` type request to test your new endpoint:
