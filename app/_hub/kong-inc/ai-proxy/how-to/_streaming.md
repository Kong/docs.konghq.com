title: Configure Streaming with AI Proxy

This guide walks you through setting up the AI Proxy plugin with streaming.

## How it works

Streaming is a mode where a client can specify `"stream": true` in their request and the LLM server will stream each piece of the response text (usually token-by-token) as a server-sent event.

Kong captures each batch of events and translates them back into the Kong inference format, so that all providers are compatible with the same framework that you create on your side (including [OpenAI-compatible SDKs](/hub/kong-inc/ai-proxy/how-to/sdk-usage/) or similar).

In a standard LLM transaction, requests proxied directly to the LLM look like this:

{% mermaid %}
sequenceDiagram    
  actor Client
  participant Kong
  Note right of Kong: AI Proxy plugin
  Client->>+Kong: 
  destroy Kong
  Kong->>+Cloud LLM: Sends proxy request information
  Cloud LLM->>+Client: Sends chunk to client
{% endmermaid %}

When streaming is requested, requests proxied directly to the LLM look like this:

{% mermaid %}

  A(client)
  B(Kong Gateway with 
  AI Proxy plugin)
  C(Cloud LLM)
  D[[transform frame]]
  E[[read frame]]

  A
  end
  subgraph 3
  C
  end
  subgraph 2
  D
  E
  end
  A --> B --request--> C
  C --response--> B
  B --> D-->E
  E --> B
  B --> A
end

  style 1 color:#fff,stroke:#fff
  style 2 color:#fff,stroke:#fff
  style 3 color:#fff,stroke:#fff
  style main color:#fff,stroke:#fff
{% endmermaid %}

The new streaming framework captures each event, sends the chunk back to the client, and then exits early. 

It will also estimate tokens for LLM services that decided to not stream back the token use counts when the message completed.

## Streaming limitations

Keep the following limitations in mind when you configure streaming for the AI Proxy plugin: 

* Multiple AI features shouldnâ€™t expect to be applied and work simultaneously
* You cannot use the [Response Transformer plugin](/hub/kong-inc/response-transformer/) plugin or any other "response" phase plugin when streaming is configured
* The [AI Request Transformer plugin](/hub/kong-inc/ai-request-transformer/) plugin **will** work, but the [AI Response Transformer plugin](/hub/kong-inc/ai-response-transformer/) **will not**. This is a limitation of the fact that Kong cannot check every single response token against a separate system.
* Streaming currently doesn't work with the HTTP/2 protocol. You must disable this in your `proxy_listen` configuration.

## Configuration

The `ai-proxy` plugin already supports request streaming, all you have to do is request {{site.base_gateway}} to stream the response tokens back to you.

The following is an example `llm/v1/completions` route-type streaming request:

```json
{
  "prompt": "What is the theory of relativity?",
  "stream": true
}
```

You should receive each batch of tokens as HTTP chunks, each containing one or many server-sent events.

### Response streaming configuration parameters

In the AI Proxy plugin configuration, you can set an optional field `config.response_streaming` to one of three values:

| Value  | Effect                                                                                    |
|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `allow`  | Allows the caller to optionally specify a streaming response in their request (default is not-stream) |
| `deny`   | Prevents the caller from setting `stream=true` in their request                                           |
| `always` | Always returns streaming responses, even if the caller hasn't specified it in their request       |
