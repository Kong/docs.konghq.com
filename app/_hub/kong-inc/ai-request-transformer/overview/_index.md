The AI Request Transformer plugin uses a configured LLM service to introspect and transform the client's request body before
proxying the request upstream.

This plugin supports `llm/v1/chat` style requests for all of the same providers as the [AI Proxy plugin](/hub/kong-inc/ai-proxy/).

It also uses all of the same configuration and tuning parameters as the AI Proxy plugin, under the [`config.llm`](/hub/kong-inc/ai-request-transformer/configuration/#config-llm) block.

The AI Request Transformer plugin runs **after** all of the [AI Prompt](/hub/?search=ai%2520prompt) plugins, but **before** the
AI Proxy plugin, allowing it to also introspect LLM requests against the same, or a different, LLM.

> _**Figure 1**: The diagram shows the journey of a consumer's request through {{site.base_gateway}} to the 
backend service, where it is transformed by both an AI LLM service and Kong's AI Request Transformer and the AI Response Transformer plugins._

1. The {{site.base_gateway}} admin sets up an `llm:` configuration block, following the same 
[configuration format](/hub/kong-inc/ai-proxy/configuration/) as the AI Proxy plugin, 
and the same `driver` capabilities.
1. The {{site.base_gateway}} admin sets up a `prompt` for the request introspection. 
The prompt becomes the `system` message in the LLM chat request, and prepares the LLM with transformation
instructions for the incoming user request body.
1. The user makes an HTTP(S) call.
1. Before proxying the user's request to the backend, {{site.base_gateway}} sets the entire request body as the 
`user` message in the LLM chat request, and then sends it to the configured LLM service.
1. The LLM service returns a response `assistant` message, which is subsequently set as the upstream request body.
