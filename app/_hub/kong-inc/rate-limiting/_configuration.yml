name: Rate Limiting
dbless_compatible: partially
dbless_explanation: |
  The plugin will run fine with the `local` policy (which doesn't use the database) or
  the `redis` policy (which uses an independent Redis, so it is compatible with DB-less).

  The plugin will not work with the `cluster` policy, which requires writes to the database.
