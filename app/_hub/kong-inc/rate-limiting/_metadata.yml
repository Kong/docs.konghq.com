name: Rate Limiting
dbless_compatible: partially
dbless_explanation: |
  The plugin will run fine with the `local` policy (which doesn't use the database) or
  the `redis` policy (which uses an independent Redis, so it is compatible with DB-less).

  The plugin will not work with the `cluster` policy, which requires writes to the database.

desc: Rate-limit how many HTTP requests can be made in a period of time
description: |
  Rate limit how many HTTP requests can be made in a given period of seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, or years.
  If the underlying Service/Route (or deprecated API entity) has no authentication layer,
  the **Client IP** address will be used; otherwise, the Consumer will be used if an
  authentication plugin has been configured.

  **Tip:** The [Rate Limiting Advanced](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced/)
    plugin provides the ability to apply
    [multiple limits in sliding or fixed windows](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting-advanced/#multi-limits-windows).
