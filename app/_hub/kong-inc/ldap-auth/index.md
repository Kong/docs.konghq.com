description: |
  Add LDAP Bind Authentication to a Route with username and password protection. The plugin
  checks for valid credentials in the `Proxy-Authorization` and `Authorization` headers
  (in that order).

  This plugin is the open-source version of the [LDAP Authentication Advanced plugin](/hub/kong-inc/ldap-auth-advanced/), which provides
  additional features such as LDAP searches for group and consumer mapping:
  * Ability to authenticate based on username or custom ID.
  * The ability to bind to an enterprise LDAP directory with a password.
  * The ability to authenticate/authorize using a group base DN and specific group member or group name attributes.

## Usage

To authenticate a user, the client must set credentials in either the
`Proxy-Authorization` or `Authorization` header in the following format:

    credentials := [ldap | LDAP] base64(username:password)

The Authorization header would look something like:

    Authorization:  ldap dGxibGVzc2luZzpLMG5nU3RyMG5n

The plugin validates the user against the LDAP server and caches the
credentials for future requests for the duration specified in
`config.cache_ttl`.

You can set the header type `ldap` to any string (such as `basic`) using
`config.header_type`.

### Upstream Headers

When a client has been authenticated, the plugin appends some headers to the
request before proxying it to the upstream service so that you can identify
the consumer in your code:

* `X-Anonymous-Consumer`, will be set to `true` when authentication failed, and the 'anonymous' consumer was set instead.
* `X-Consumer-ID`, the ID of the 'anonymous' consumer on Kong (only if authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)
* `X-Consumer-Custom-ID`, the `custom_id` of the 'anonymous' consumer (only if authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)
* `X-Consumer-Username`, the `username` of the 'anonymous' consumer (only if authentication failed and 'anonymous' was set)
* `X-Credential-Identifier`, the identifier of the Credential (only if the consumer is not the 'anonymous' consumer)

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong>`X-Credential-Username` was deprecated in favor of `X-Credential-Identifier` in Kong 2.1.
