{{site.base_gateway}} integrates with Dynatrace through Kongâ€™s [OpenTelemetry](/hub/kong-inc/opentelemetry/), [Prometheus](/hub/kong-inc/prometheus/), and [logging](/hub/?category=logging) plugins.
This guide shows you how to set up Dynatrace with Kong's OpenTelemetry plugin.

{{site.base_gateway}}'s plugins send signals to the Dynatrace Collector which is responsible for updating the Dynatrace tenant with {{site.base_gateway}} traces, metrics, and logs.

This is a {{site.base_gateway}} integration and is fully supported by Kong through the existing plugins available in {{site.base_gateway}}.
