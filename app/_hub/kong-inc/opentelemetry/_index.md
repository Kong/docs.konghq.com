## Queueing

The OpenTelemetry plugin uses a queue to decouple the production and
consumption of data. This reduces the number of concurrent requests
made to the upstream server under high load situations and provides
buffering during temporary network or upstream outages.

You can set several parameters to configure the behavior and capacity
of the queues used by the plugin. For more information about how to
use these parameters, see
[Plugin Queuing Reference](/gateway/latest/kong-plugins/queue/reference/)
in the {{site.base_gateway}} documentation.

The queue parameters all reside in a record under the key `queue` in
the `config` parameter section of the plugin.

## Usage

{% if_plugin_version gte:3.2.x %}
{:.note}
> **Note**: The OpenTelemetry plugin only works when {{site.base_gateway}}'s `tracing_instrumentations` configuration is enabled.
{% endif_plugin_version %}

{% if_plugin_version lte:3.1.x %}
{:.note}
> **Note**: The OpenTelemetry plugin only works when {{site.base_gateway}}'s `opentelemetry_tracing` configuration is enabled.
{% endif_plugin_version %}

The OpenTelemetry plugin is fully compatible with the OpenTelemetry specification and can be used with any OpenTelemetry compatible backend.

There are two ways to set up an OpenTelemetry backend:
* Using a OpenTelemetry compatible backend directly, like Jaeger (v1.35.0+)
   All the vendors supported by OpenTelemetry are listed in the [OpenTelemetry's Vendor support](https://opentelemetry.io/vendors/).
* Using the OpenTelemetry Collector, which is middleware that can be used to proxy OpenTelemetry spans to a compatible backend.
   You can view all the available OpenTelemetry Collector exporters at [open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/exporter).

### Set up {{site.base_gateway}}

Enable the OpenTelemetry tracing capability in {{site.base_gateway}}'s configuration:
{% if_plugin_version lte:3.1.x %}
- `opentelemetry_tracing = all`, Valid values can be found in the [Kong's configuration](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#tracing_instrumentations).
- `opentelemetry_tracing_sampling_rate = 1.0`: Tracing instrumentation sampling rate.
  Tracer samples a fixed percentage of all spans following the sampling rate.
  Set the sampling rate to a lower value to reduce the impact of the instrumentation on {{site.base_gateway}}'s proxy performance in production.
{% endif_plugin_version %}
{% if_plugin_version gte:3.2.x %}
- `tracing_instrumentations = all`, Valid values can be found in the [Kong's configuration](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#tracing_instrumentations).
- `tracing_sampling_rate = 1.0`: Tracing instrumentation sampling rate.
  Tracer samples a fixed percentage of all spans following the sampling rate.
  Set the sampling rate to a lower value to reduce the impact of the instrumentation on {{site.base_gateway}}'s proxy performance in production.
{% endif_plugin_version %}
### Set up an OpenTelemetry compatible backend

This section is optional if you are using a OpenTelemetry compatible APM vendor.
All the supported vendors are listed in the [OpenTelemetry's Vendor support](https://opentelemetry.io/vendors/).

Jaeger [natively supports OpenTelemetry](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/features/#native-support-for-opentracing-and-opentelemetry) starting with v1.35 and can be used with the OpenTelemetry plugin.

Deploy a Jaeger instance with Docker:

```bash
docker run --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED=true \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:1.36
```

* The `COLLECTOR_OTLP_ENABLED` environment variable must be set to `true` to enable the OpenTelemetry Collector.

* The `4318` port is the OTLP/HTTP port and the `4317` port is the OTLP/GRPC port that isn't supported by the OpenTelemetry plugin yet.

### Set up a OpenTelemetry Collector

This section is required if you are using an incompatible OpenTelemetry APM vendor.

Create a config file (`otelcol.yaml`) for the OpenTelemetry Collector:

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      http:

processors:
  batch:

exporters:
  logging:
    loglevel: debug
  zipkin:
    endpoint: "http://some.url:9411/api/v2/spans"
    tls:
      insecure: true

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [logging, zipkin]
```

Run the OpenTelemetry Collector with Docker:

```bash
docker run --name opentelemetry-collector \
  -p 4317:4317 \
  -p 4318:4318 \
  -p 55679:55679 \
  -v $(pwd)/otelcol.yaml:/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml \
  otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:0.52.0 \
  --config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml
```

See the [OpenTelemetry Collector documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/configuration/) for more information.

### Configure the OpenTelemetry plugin

Enable the plugin:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<admin-hostname>:8001/plugins \
    --data "name=opentelemetry"  \
    --data "config.endpoint=http://<opentelemetry-backend>:4318/v1/traces" \
    --data "config.resource_attributes.service.name=kong-dev"
```

## How the OpenTelemetry plugin functions

This section describes how the OpenTelemetry plugin works.

### Built-in tracing instrumentations

{% if_plugin_version gte:3.2.x %}
{{site.base_gateway}} has a series of built-in tracing instrumentations
which are configured by the `tracing_instrumentations` configuration.
{{site.base_gateway}} creates a top-level span for each request by default when `tracing_instrumentations` is enabled.
{% endif_plugin_version %}
{% if_plugin_version lte:3.1.x %}
{{site.base_gateway}} has a series of built-in tracing instrumentations
which are configured by the `opentelemetry_tracing` configuration.
{{site.base_gateway}} creates a top-level span for each request by default when `opentelemetry_tracing` is enabled.
{% endif_plugin_version %}

The top level span has the following attributes:
- `http.method`: HTTP method
- `http.url`: HTTP URL
- `http.host`: HTTP host
- `http.scheme`: HTTP scheme (http or https)
- `http.flavor`: HTTP version
- `net.peer.ip`: Client IP address

<!-- TODO: link to Gateway 3.0 tracing docs for details -->

### Propagation

The OpenTelemetry plugin propagates the following headers:
- `w3c`: [W3C trace context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/)
- `b3` and `b3-single`: [Zipkin headers](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation)
- `jaeger`: [Jaeger headers](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/client-libraries/#propagation-format)
- `ot`: [OpenTracing headers](https://github.com/opentracing/specification/blob/master/rfc/trace_identifiers.md)
- `datadog`: [Datadog headers](https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/trace_collection/library_config/go/#trace-context-propagation-for-distributed-tracing) (Enterprise only)

The plugin detects the propagation format from the headers and will use the appropriate format to propagate the span context.
If no appropriate format is found, the plugin will fallback to the default format, which is `w3c`.

### OTLP exporter

The OpenTelemetry plugin implements the [OTLP/HTTP](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md#otlphttp) exporter, which uses Protobuf payloads encoded in binary format and is sent via HTTP/1.1.

`connect_timeout`, `read_timeout`, and `write_timeout` are used to set the timeouts for the HTTP request.

`batch_span_count` and `batch_flush_delay` are used to set the maximum number of spans and the delay between two consecutive batches.

## Customize OpenTelemetry spans as a developer

<!-- TODO: link to Gateway 3.0 tracing pdk docs for reference -->

The OpenTelemetry plugin is built on top of the {{site.base_gateway}} tracing PDK.

It's possible to customize the spans and add your own spans through the universal tracing PDK.

The following is an example for adding a custom span using {{site.base_gateway}}'s serverless plugin:

1. Create a file named `custom-span.lua` with the following content:

    ```lua
      -- Modify the root span
      local root_span = kong.tracing.active_span()
      root_span:set_attribute("custom.attribute", "custom value")

      -- Create a custom span
      local span = kong.tracing.start_span("custom-span")

      -- Append attributes
      span:set_attribute("custom.attribute", "custom value")
      
      -- Close the span
      span:finish()
    ```

2. Apply the Lua code using the `post-function` plugin using a cURL file upload:

    ```bash
    curl -i -X POST http://<admin-hostname>:8001/plugins \
      -F "name=post-function" \
      -F "config.access[1]=@custom-span.lua"

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    ...
    ```

## Troubleshooting

The OpenTelemetry spans are printed to the console when the log level is set to `debug` in the Kong configuration file.

An example of debug logs output:

```bash
2022/06/02 15:28:42 [debug] 650#0: *111 [lua] instrumentation.lua:302: runloop_log_after(): [tracing] collected 6 spans:
