desc: Integrate Kong with a third-party OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server
description: |
  Validate access tokens sent by developers using a third-party OAuth 2.0
  Authorization Server by leveraging its introspection endpoint
  ([RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662)). This plugin assumes that
  the consumer already has an access token that will be validated against a
  third-party OAuth 2.0 server.

  {:.note}
  > **Note**: The [OpenID Connect Plugin][oidcplugin] supports
  OAuth 2.0 Token Introspection as well and offers functionality beyond
  this plugin, such as restricting access by scope.

        The full URL to the third-party introspection endpoint.

        If the introspection endpoint is `https`, [`lua_ssl_trusted_certificate`](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#lua_ssl_trusted_certificate)
        must be set in `kong.conf` to ensure the plugin can connect
        to the endpoint. The CA bundle file location depends on your OS. See the
        [configuration reference](/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#lua_ssl_trusted_certificate) for a list.

        Starting with Kong v2.2, users can set `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate=system`
        to automatically use the CA bundle from the OS.

        The value to set as the `Authorization` header when querying the introspection endpoint. This depends on the OAuth 2.0 server, but usually is the `client_id` and `client_secret` as a Base64-encoded Basic Auth string (`Basic MG9hNWl...`).

        An optional string (consumer UUID or username) value to use as an “anonymous” consumer if authentication fails.

        `X-Request-Path` and `X-Request-Http-Method` will be inserted into the
        introspect request.

## Flow

![OAuth2 Introspection Flow](/assets/images/docs/oauth2/oauth2-introspection.png)

## Associate the response to a consumer

To associate the introspection response resolution to a Kong consumer, provision a Kong consumer with the same `username` returned by the Introspection Endpoint response.

## Upstream headers

When a client has been authenticated, the plugin appends the following headers to the request before proxying it to the upstream API/microservice.
Use these headers to identify the consumer in your code:

- `X-Consumer-ID`, the ID of the consumer on Kong (if matched)
- `X-Consumer-Custom-ID`, the `custom_id` of the consumer (if matched and if existing)
- `X-Consumer-Username`, the `username of` the consumer (if matched and if existing)
- `X-Anonymous-Consumer`, set to true if authentication fails, and the `anonymous` consumer is set instead.
- `X-Credential-Scope`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Client-ID`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Identifier`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Token-Type`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Exp`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Iat`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Nbf`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Sub`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Aud`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Iss`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Jti`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)

Additionally, any claims specified in `config.custom_claims_forward` are also forwarded with the `X-Credential-` prefix.

{:.note}
> **Note:** If authentication fails, the plugin doesn't set any `X-Credential-*` headers.
It appends `X-Anonymous-Consumer: true` and sets the `anonymous` consumer instead.

## Changelog

**{{site.base_gateway}} 3.0.x**
* The deprecated `X-Credential-Username` header has been removed.
