desc: Integrate Kong with a third-party OAuth 2.0 Authorization Server
description: |
  Validate access tokens sent by developers using a third-party OAuth 2.0
  Authorization Server, by leveraging its Introspection Endpoint
  ([RFC 7662](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7662)). This plugin assumes that
  the Consumer already has an access token that will be validated against a
  third-party OAuth 2.0 server.

### Flow

![OAuth2 Introspection Flow](/assets/images/docs/oauth2/oauth2-introspection.png)

### Associate the response to a Consumer

To associate the introspection response resolution to a Kong Consumer, you will have to provision a Kong Consumer with the same `username` returned by the Introspection Endpoint response.

### Upstream Headers

When a client has been authenticated, the plugin will append some headers to the request before proxying it to the upstream API/Microservice, so that you can identify the consumer in your code:

- `X-Consumer-ID`, the ID of the Consumer on Kong (if matched)
- `X-Consumer-Custom-ID`, the custom_id of the Consumer (if matched and if existing)
- `X-Consumer-Username`, the username of the Consumer (if matched and if existing)
- `X-Anonymous-Consumer`, will be set to true when authentication failed, and the 'anonymous' consumer was set instead.
- `X-Credential-Scope`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Client-ID`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Username`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Token-Type`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Exp`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Iat`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Nbf`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Sub`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Aud`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Iss`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)
- `X-Credential-Jti`, as returned by the Introspection response (if any)

Note: Aforementioned `X-Credential-*` headers are not set when authentication failed, and the 'anonymous' consumer was set instead.
