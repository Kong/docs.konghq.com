## Overview

The AI Response Transformer plugin is designed to operate in two ways:

* As a transformer/security arbiter for your existing upstream APIs
* As an extension of another AI Proxy LLM route, inspecting and transforming the responses before sending to the upstream LLM service

The plugin configuration consists of two distinct sections:

* The LLM configuration, which uses the same [configuration options](/hub/kong-inc/ai-proxy/configuration/) as the AI Proxy plugin.
* The prompt (and additional options) containing the **instructions** for the LLM, which will transform your request.

See the same LLM block in the context of the AI Proxy plugin and the AI Response Transformer plugin:

{% navtabs %}

{% navtab AI Proxy %}

```yaml
config:
  route_type: "llm/v1/chat"
  auth:
    header_name: "Authorization"
    header_value: "Bearer <azure_key>"  # add your own Azure API key
  model:
      provider: "azure"
      name: "gpt-3.5"
      azure_instance: "azure-openai-service"
      azure_deployment_id: "gpt-3-5-deployment"
```

{% endnavtab %}

{% navtab AI Response Transformer %}

```yaml
llm:
  config:
    route_type: "llm/v1/chat"
    auth:
      header_name: "Authorization"
      header_value: "Bearer <azure_key>"  # add your own Azure API key
    model:
      provider: "azure"
      name: "gpt-3.5"
      azure_instance: "azure-openai-service"
      azure_deployment_id: "gpt-3-5-deployment"

prompt: "Mask all credit card numbers in my JSON message with '*'. Return me ONLY the resulting JSON."
```

{% endnavtab %}

{% endnavtabs %}

When the plugin is accessed in any scope (global, service, route, or consumer), it **always** sets the upstream's response
body as the `user` prompt in a chat message, and then sends it to the configured `llm:` configuration block for inspection or transformation.

## Examples

### Transforming existing API traffic

This example uses `ai-response-transformer` on an *existing* API, for example, something that you have already developed and maintain internally.

1. **Design the prompt**.

    For this example, we want to intercept *responses from* the `customers` API. 
    On each client response, the plugin needs to forward it to the configured large language model, and ask
    the LLM to mask all credit card numbers with asterisk characters.

    The plugin would be configured like this:

    ```yaml
    config:
      prompt: >
        Mask all credit card numbers in my JSON message with '*'. Return me ONLY the resulting JSON.
      llm:
        # see `ai-proxy` plugin documentation for compatible fields for the "llm" block
    ```

2. **Attach the plugin**.

    Attach the `ai-response-transformer` plugin to the global level, route, service, or consumer on which you want to inspect/transform all responses.

    It can even be used on APIs that already have the `ai-request-transformer` plugin, or it can be used on its own.

3. **What happens next?**

    First, an upstream API responds to a client request. For example:

    ```json
    {
      "user": {
        "name": "Kong User",
        "city": "London",
        "credit_card_no": "1234-5678-9012-3456"
      }
    }
    ```

    Next, Kong parses this into an `llm/v1/chat` type message, based on your [`config.prompt`](/hub/kong-inc/ai-response-transformer/configuration/#config-prompt):

    ```json
    {
      "messages": [
        {
          "role": "system",
          "content": "Mask all credit card numbers in my JSON message with '*'. Return me ONLY the resulting JSON."
        },
        {
          "role": "user",
          "content": "{\n\"user\":{\n\"name\":\"Kong User\",\n\"city\":\"London\"\n\"credit_card_no\":\"1234-5678-9012-3456\"}\n}"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
    
    Finally, it sends this to the configured LLM. On the response, it takes the trailing `assistant` response back from the LLM, and
    sets it as the HTTP body that will return to the original client:

    ```json
    {
      "user": {
        "name": "Kong User",
        "city": "London",
        "credit_card_no": "****-****-****-****"
      }
    }
    ```

#### Extraction patterns

If your LLM is a chatbot type, or is unpredictable in responses, you can configure the additional field `transformation_extract_pattern`
with a (PCRE) regular expression to extract the first match from the LLM's response.

For example, if you have asked for a JSON response but you know that your LLM may add its own text around your answer, use this extraction pattern to
withdraw **only** the JSON object from the LLM's response:

```yaml
config:
  prompt: >
    Mask all credit card numbers in my JSON message with '*'. Return me ONLY the resulting JSON.
  transformation_extract_pattern: '\\{((.|\n)*)\\}'
```

### Setting body, headers, and status code

The AI Response Transformer can modify any of the following response sections independently:

* Headers
* Status code
* Body

This allows the Kong admin to configure the LLM to fully orchestrate the response phase inside {{site.base_gateway}}.

Enable this feature by setting the config option [`parse_llm_response_json_instructions`](/hub/kong-inc/ai-response-transformer/configuration/#config-parse_llm_response_json_instructions).

1. **Design the prompt**.

    For this example, we want to intercept *responses from* our `customers` API. 
    On each client response, the plugin forwards the response to the configured large language model, and asks
    the LLM to mask all credit card numbers with asterisk characters.

    The plugin would be configured like this:

    ```yaml
    config:
      prompt: >
        If my JSON message has the user's name 'Kong User', then return this exact JSON message: 
        {"status": 400, "headers": {"x-failed": "true"}, "body": "VALIDATION_FAILURE"}
      parse_llm_response_json_instructions: true
      llm:
        # see `ai-proxy` plugin documentation for compatible fields for the "llm" block
    ```

2. **Attach the plugin**.

    Attach the `ai-response-transformer` plugin to the global level, route, service, or consumer on which you want to inspect/transform all responses.

    It can even be used on APIs that already have the `ai-request-transformer` plugin, or it can be used on its own.

3. **What happens next?**

    First, an upstream API responds to a client request, for example:

    ```json
    {
      "user": {
        "name": "Kong User",
        "city": "London",
        "credit_card_no": "1234-5678-9012-3456"
      }
    }
    ```

    Once sent to the LLM, the response will be:

    ```json
    {
      "status": 400,
      "headers": {
        "x-failed": "true"
      },
      "body": "VALIDATION_FAILURE"
    }
    ```

    Kong will do the following actions:

    * Set each response header from the `headers` object
    * Set the HTTP status code to the `status` integer
    * Set the body to be the `body` string
