name: Rate Limiting Advanced
publisher: Kong Inc.
version: 0.31-x

desc: Upgrades Kong Rate Limiting with more flexibility and higher performance
description: |
  The Rate Limiting Advanced plugin for Kong Enterprise is a
  re-engineered version of the incredibly popular Kong Rate Limiting plugin,
  with greatly enhanced configuration options and performance.

  Note that in Kong Enterprise 0.31 only, this plugin was referred to
  as `rate-limiting` - and the same-named Kong plugin was
  not included in Kong Enterprise 0.31. Later versions of Kong Enterprise included both this
  plugin (named `rate-limiting-advanced` in those later versions) and the
  `rate-limiting` plugin from Kong.

    **Note:  Redis configuration values are ignored if the `cluster` strategy is used.**

    **Note: PostgreSQL 9.5+ is required when using the `cluster` strategy with
    `postgres` as the backing Kong cluster data store. This requirement varies
    from the PostgreSQL 9.4+ requirement as described in the
    <a href="/install/source">Kong documentation</a>.**

### Notes

An arbitrary number of limits/window sizes can be applied per plugin instance. This allows users to create multiple rate limiting windows (e.g., rate limit per minute and per hour, and/or per any arbitrary window size); because of limitation with Kong's plugin configuration interface, each *nth* limit will apply to each *nth* window size. For example:

```
$ curl -i -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \
  --data name=rate-limiting \
  --data config.limit=10,100 \
  --data config.window_size=60,3600 \
  --data config.sync_rate=10
```
This will apply rate limiting policies, one of which will trip when 10 hits have been counted in 60 seconds, or when 100 hits have been counted in 3600 seconds.
