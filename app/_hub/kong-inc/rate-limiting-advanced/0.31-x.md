name: Rate Limiting Advanced
publisher: Kong Inc.
version: 0.31-x

desc: Upgrades Kong Rate Limiting with more flexibility and higher performance
description: |
  The Rate Limiting Advanced plugin for Kong Enterprise Edition (EE) is a
  re-engineered version of the incredibly popular Kong Rate Limiting plugin,
  with greatly enhanced configuration options and performance.

  Note that in Kong (EE) 0.31 only, this plugin was referred to
  as `rate-limiting` - and the same-named Kong Community Edition (CE) plugin was
  not included in Kong EE 0.31. Later versions of Kong EE included both this
  plugin (named `rate-limiting-advanced` in those later versions) and the
  `rate-limiting` plugin from Kong CE.

        This sets the time window to either `sliding` or `fixed`.
        Sliding windows [factor in weighted request counts from previous time segments][ratelimit-library] when determining whether a client has
        exceeded its limit, whereas fixed windows only count requests during
        the current time segment.

      value_in_examples:
      description: |
        Controls whether `X-Ratelimit-Remaining` and `X-Ratelimit-Limit`
        headers are sent to clients. When set to `true`, headers are not
        sent/are hidden.

  extra: |
    **Note:  Redis configuration values are ignored if the `cluster` strategy is used.**

    **Note: PostgreSQL 9.5+ is required when using the `cluster` strategy with
    `postgres` as the backing Kong cluster data store. This requirement varies
    from the PostgreSQL 9.4+ requirement as described in the
    <a href="/install/source">Kong Community Edition documentation</a>.**

    **Note: The `dictionary_name` directive was added to prevent the usage
    of the `kong` shared dictionary, which could lead to `no memory` errors**

### Notes

An arbitrary number of limits/window sizes can be applied per plugin instance. This allows users to create multiple rate limiting windows (e.g., rate limit per minute and per hour, and/or per any arbitrary window size); because of limitation with Kong's plugin configuration interface, each *nth* limit will apply to each *nth* window size. For example:

```
$ curl -i -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \
  --data name=rate-limiting \
  --data config.limit=10,100 \
  --data config.window_size=60,3600 \
  --data config.sync_rate=10
```
This will apply rate limiting policies, one of which will trip when 10 hits have been counted in 60 seconds, or when 100 hits have been counted in 3600 seconds.
