    **Note:  Redis configuration values are ignored if the `cluster` strategy is used.**

    **Note: PostgreSQL 9.5+ is required when using the `cluster` strategy with `postgres` as the backing Kong cluster data store. This requirement varies from the PostgreSQL 9.4+ requirement as described in the <a href="/install/source">Kong Community Edition documentation</a>.**

    **Note: The `dictionary_name` directive was added to prevent the usage of the `kong` shared dictionary, which could lead to `no memory` errors**

### Notes

An arbitrary number of limits/window sizes can be applied per plugin instance. This allows users to create multiple rate limiting windows (e.g., rate limit per minute and per hour, and/or per any arbitrary window size); because of limitation with Kong's plugin configuration interface, each *nth* limit will apply to each *nth* window size. For example:

```bash
$ curl -i -X POST http://kong:8001/apis/{api}/plugins \
  --data name=rate-limiting-advanced \
  --data config.limit=10,100 \
  --data config.window_size=60,3600 \
  --data config.sync_rate=10
```
This will apply rate limiting policies, one of which will trip when 10 hits have been counted in 60 seconds, or when 100 hits have been counted in 3600 seconds.
