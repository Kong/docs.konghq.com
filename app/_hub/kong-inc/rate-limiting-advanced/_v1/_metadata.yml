dbless_explanation: |
  The cluster strategy is not supported in DB-less and hybrid modes. For Kong
  Gateway in DB-less or hybrid mode, the `redis` strategy is the only available option to configure the plugin with a central data store.

  {:.note}
  > **Note**: We recommend setting `namespace` to a static value in DB-less mode.
  > The `namespace` will be regenerated on every configuration change if not explicitly set, resetting counters to zero.
