name: rate-limiting-advanced
dbless_compatible: partially
dbless_explanation: |
  The cluster strategy is not supported in DB-less and hybrid modes. For Kong
  Gateway in DB-less or hybrid mode, the `redis` strategy is the only available option to configure the plugin with a central data store.

  {:.note}
  > **Note**: We recommend setting `namespace` to a static value in DB-less mode.
  > The `namespace` will be regenerated on every configuration change if not explicitly set, resetting counters to zero.

  **Notes:**

   * The plugin does not support the `cluster` strategy in
     [hybrid mode](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/hybrid-mode/).
     The `redis` strategy must be used instead.

   * Redis configuration values are ignored if the `cluster` strategy is used.

   * PostgreSQL 9.5+ is required when using the `cluster` strategy with `postgres` as the backing Kong cluster data store.

   * The `dictionary_name` directive was added to prevent the usage of the `kong` shared dictionary,
     which could lead to `no memory` errors.

desc: Upgrades Kong Rate Limiting with more flexibility and higher performance
description: |
  The Rate Limiting Advanced plugin for Konnect Enterprise is a re-engineered version of the Kong Gateway (OSS) [Rate Limiting plugin](/hub/kong-inc/rate-limiting/).

  As compared to the standard Rate Limiting plugin, Rate Limiting Advanced provides:
  * Enhanced capabilities to tune the rate limiter, provided by the parameters `limit` and `window_size`. Learn more in [Multiple Limits and Window Sizes](#multi-limits-windows)
  * Support for Redis Sentinel, Redis cluster, and Redis SSL
  * Increased performance: Rate Limiting Advanced has better throughput performance with better accuracy. The plugin allows you to tune performance and accuracy via a configurable synchronization of counter data with the backend storage. This can be controlled by setting the desired value on the `sync_rate` parameter.
  * More limiting algorithms to choose from: These algorithms are more accurate and they enable configuration with more specificity. Learn more about our algorithms in [How to Design a Scalable Rate Limiting Algorithm](https://konghq.com/blog/how-to-design-a-scalable-rate-limiting-algorithm).
  * Consumer groups support: Apply different rate limiting configurations to select groups of consumers. Learn more in [Rate limiting for consumer groups](#rate-limiting-for-consumer-groups)
