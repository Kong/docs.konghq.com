The AI Prompt Decorator plugin adds an array of `llm/v1/chat` messages to either the start or end of an LLM consumer's chat history.
This allows you to pre-engineer complex prompts, or steer (and guard) prompts in such a way that the modification to the consumer's
LLM message is completely transparent.

You can use this plugin to pre-set a system prompt, set up specific prompt history, add words and phrases, or otherwise have more
control over how an LLM service is used when called via {{site.base_gateway}}.
