  extra: |
    **Reminder**: By default, cURL sends payloads with an
    `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` MIME type, which will naturally be URL-
    decoded by Kong. To ensure special characters that are likely to appear in
    your AWS key or secret (like `+`) are correctly decoded, you must
    URL-encode them with `--data-urlencode`.
    Alternatives to this approach would be to send your payload with a
    different MIME type (like `application/json`), or to use a different HTTP client.

### Sending parameters

Any form parameter sent along with the request will be also sent as an
argument to the AWS Lambda function.

### Notes

If you do not provide an `aws.key` and `aws.secret`, the plugin uses an IAM role inherited from the instance running Kong.

First, the plugin will try ECS metadata to get the role. If no ECS metadata is available, the plugin will fall back on EC2 metadata.

### Known Issues

#### Use a fake upstream service

When using the AWS Lambda plugin, the response will be returned by the plugin
itself without proxying the request to any upstream service. This means that
a Service's `host`, `port`, and `path` properties will be ignored, but must
still be specified for the entity to be validated by Kong. The `host` property
in particular must either be an IP address, or a hostname that gets resolved by
your nameserver.

#### Response plugins

There is a known limitation in the system that prevents some response plugins
from being executed. We are planning to remove this limitation in the future.

### Step-By-Step Guide

#### Steps

Prerequisite: You must have access to the AWS Console as a user who is
allowed to operate with lambda functions, and create users and roles.

1. Create an Execution role in AWS.
2. Create a user that will invoke the function via Kong and test it.
3. Create a Service and Route in Kong, add the aws-lambda plugin linked to
our AWS function, and execute it.

#### Configure

1. First, create an execution role called `LambdaExecutor` for your
lambda function.

    In the IAM Console, create a new Role choosing the AWS Lambda service. There
    will be no policies because the function in this example will simply execute
    itself, returning a hardcoded JSON response without accessing other
    AWS resources.

2. Create a user named `KongInvoker`, used by the Kong API gateway
to invoke the function.

    In the IAM Console, create a new user. Programmatic access must be provided to the user via Access and Secret keys. Then, attach existing policies directly, particularly the predefined `AWSLambdaRole`. After the user creation is confirmed, store the Access Key and Secret Key in a safe place.

3. Next, create the lambda function itself in the N. Virginia Region
(code `us-east-1`).

    In Lambda Management, create a new function `MyLambda`. There will be no blueprint because you are going to paste the code below (which is an example code snippet). For the execution role, choose the `LambdaExecutor` created previously.

    **Note**: The following code snippet is only an example. The Kong AWS Lambda plugin supports all runtimes provided by AWS. See the list of runtimes in the **AWS Lambda** > **Functions** > **Create function** dialog.

    ```python
    import json
    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        """
          If is_proxy_integration is set to true :
          jsonbody='''{"statusCode": 200, "body": {"response": "yes"}}'''
        """
        jsonbody='''{"response": "yes"}'''
        return json.loads(jsonbody)
    ```

    Test the lambda function from the AWS console and make sure the execution succeeds.

4. Set up a Service and Route in Kong and link it to the
`MyLambda` function you just created.

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab With a database %}

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://{kong_hostname}:8001/services \
--data 'name=lambda1' \
--data 'url=http://localhost:8000' \
```

The Service doesn't really need a real `url` because this example won't have an HTTP call to an Upstream but rather a response generated by the lambda function.

Also create a Route for the Service:

```
curl -i -X POST http://{kong_hostname}:8001/services/lambda1/routes \
--data 'paths[1]=/lambda1'
```

Add the plugin:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://{kong_hostname}:8001/services/lambda1/plugins \
--data 'name=aws-lambda' \
--data-urlencode 'config.aws_key={KongInvoker user key}' \
--data-urlencode 'config.aws_secret={KongInvoker user secret}' \
--data 'config.aws_region=us-east-1' \
--data 'config.function_name=MyLambda'
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Without a database %}

Add a Service, Route, and Plugin to the declarative config file:

``` yaml
services:
- name: lambda1
  url: http://localhost:8000

routes:
- service: lambda1
  paths: [ "/lambda1" ]

plugins:
- service: lambda1
  name: aws-lambda
  config:
    aws_key: {KongInvoker user key}
    aws_secret: {KongInvoker user secret}
    aws_region: us-east-1
    function_name: MyLambda
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

After everything is created, call the Service and verify the correct
invocation, execution, and response:

```bash
curl http://{kong_hostname}:8000/lambda1
```

Additional headers:

```
x-amzn-Remapped-Content-Length, X-Amzn-Trace-Id, x-amzn-RequestId
```

JSON response:

```json
{"response": "yes"}
```

Have fun leveraging the power of AWS Lambda in Kong!
