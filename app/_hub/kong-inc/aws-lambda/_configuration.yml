  **Reminder**: By default, cURL sends payloads with an
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` MIME type, which will naturally be URL-
  decoded by Kong. To ensure special characters that are likely to appear in
  your AWS key or secret (like `+`) are correctly decoded, you must
  URL-encode them with `--data-urlencode`.
  Alternatives to this approach would be to send your payload with a
  different MIME type (like `application/json`), or to use a different HTTP client.
