  extra: |
    **Reminder**: cURL by default sends payloads with an
    `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` MIME type, which will naturally be URL-
    decoded by Kong. To ensure special characters that are likely to appear in
    your AWS key or secret (like `+`) are correctly decoded, you must
    URL-encode them, hence use `--data-urlencode` if you are using cURL.
    Alternatives to this approach would be to send your payload with a
    different MIME type (like `application/json`), or to use a different HTTP client.

### Sending parameters

Any form parameter sent along with the request will be also sent as an
argument to the AWS Lambda function.

### Notes

If you do not provide an `aws.key` and `aws.secret`, the plugin attempts to use an IAM role inherited from the instance running Kong.

The plugin will first try ECS metadata to fetch the role; if no ECS metadata is available, the plugin will fall back on EC2 metadata.

### Known Issues

#### Use a fake upstream service

When using the AWS Lambda plugin, the response will be returned by the plugin
itself without proxying the request to any upstream service. This means that
a Service's `host`, `port`, and `path` properties will be ignored, but must
still be specified for the entity to be validated by Kong. The `host` property
in particular must either be an IP address, or a hostname that gets resolved by
your nameserver.

#### Response plugins

There is a known limitation in the system that prevents some response plugins
from being executed. We are planning to remove this limitation in the future.

### Step-By-Step Guide

#### Steps

You must have access to the AWS Console as a user who is allowed to operate
with lambda functions, and create users and roles.

1. Create an Execution role in AWS.
2. Create a user that will invoke the function via Kong and test it.
3. Create a Service and Route in Kong, add the aws-lambda plugin linked to
our AWS function, and execute it.

#### Configure

1. First, let's create an execution role called `LambdaExecutor` for our
lambda function.

    In the IAM Console, create a new Role choosing the AWS Lambda service. There
    will be no policies as our function in this example will simply execute
    itself, giving us back a hardcoded JSON response without accessing other
    AWS resources.

2. Now let's create a user named `KongInvoker`, used by our Kong API gateway
to invoke the function.

    In the IAM Console, create a new user. Programmatic access must be provided to the user via Access and Secret keys. Then attach existing policies directly, particularly the predefined `AWSLambdaRole`. After the user creation is confirmed, store the Access Key and Secret Key in a safe place.

3. Now we need to create the lambda function itself; we will do so in
N. Virginia Region (code `us-east-1`).

    In Lambda Management, create a new function `Mylambda`. There will be no blueprint because we are going to paste the code below (which is an example code snippet). Let's choose an existing role for the execution role, specifically `LambdaExecutor` created previously.

    **Note**: The following code snippet is only an example. The Kong AWS Lambda plugin supports all runtimes provided by AWS. See the list of runtimes in the **AWS Lambda** > **Functions** > **Create function** dialog.

    ```python
    import json
    def lambda_handler(event, context):
        """
          If is_proxy_integration is set to true :
          jsonbody='''{"statusCode": 200, "body": {"response": "yes"}}'''
        """
        jsonbody='''{"response": "yes"}'''
        return json.loads(jsonbody)
    ```

    Test the lambda function from the AWS console and make sure the execution succeeds.

4. Finally, we set up a Service and Route in Kong and link it to the
`Mylambda` function we just created.

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab With a database %}

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://{kong_hostname}:8001/services \
--data 'name=lambda1' \
--data 'url=http://localhost:8000' \
```

The Service doesn't really need a real `url` because we're not going to have an HTTP call to an Upstream but rather a response generated by our function.

Also create a Route for the Service:

```
curl -i -X POST http://{kong_hostname}:8001/services/lambda1/routes \
--data 'paths[1]=/lambda1'
```

Add the plugin:

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://{kong_hostname}:8001/services/lambda1/plugins \
--data 'name=aws-lambda' \
--data-urlencode 'config.aws_key={KongInvoker user key}' \
--data-urlencode 'config.aws_secret={KongInvoker user secret}' \
--data 'config.aws_region=us-east-1' \
--data 'config.function_name=MyLambda'
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Without a database %}

Add a Service, Route, and Plugin to the declarative config file:

``` yaml
services:
- name: lambda1
  url: http://localhost:8000

routes:
- service: lambda1
  paths: [ "/lambda1" ]

plugins:
- service: lambda1
  name: aws-lambda
  config:
    aws_key: {KongInvoker user key}
    aws_secret: {KongInvoker user secret}
    aws_region: us-east-1
    function_name: MyLambda
```
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

After everything is created, call the Service and verify the correct
invocation, execution, and response:

```bash
curl http://{kong_hostname}:8000/lambda1
```

Additional headers:

```
x-amzn-Remapped-Content-Length, X-Amzn-Trace-Id, x-amzn-RequestId
```

JSON response:

```json
{"response": "yes"}
```

Have fun leveraging the power of AWS Lambda in Kong!
