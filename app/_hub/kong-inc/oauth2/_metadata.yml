dbless_compatible: 'no'
dbless_explanation: |
  For its regular work, the plugin needs to both generate and delete tokens, and commit those changes to the database, which is not compatible with DB-less.

  In addition to this, its Admin API endpoints offer several POST, PATCH, PUT, and DELETE methods for tokens and credentials. None of them would work on DB-less.
extra: |

  Once applied, any user with a valid credential can access the Service.
  To restrict usage to only some of the authenticated users, also add the
  [ACL](/plugins/acl/) plugin (not covered here) and create allowed or
  denied groups of users.

notes: |
  This plugin can't be used in Konnect, hybrid, or DB-less modes. It needs to
  generate and delete tokens, and commit those changes to a database on the
  same node.

  Add an OAuth 2.0 authentication layer with the [Authorization Code Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1), [Client Credentials](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4),
  [Implicit Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.2), or [Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.3) flow.

  > **Note:** As per the OAuth2 specs, this plugin requires the
    underlying service to be served over HTTPS. To avoid any
    confusion, we recommend that you configure the route used to serve the
    underlying service to only accept HTTPS traffic (using its `protocols`
    property).
