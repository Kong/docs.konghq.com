desc: Slowly roll out software changes to a subset of users
description: |
  Reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users. This plugin also enables roll back to your original upstream service, or shift all traffic to the new version.

### Usage

The Canary Release plugin allows you to route traffic to two separate upstream
**Services** referred to as _Service A_ and _Service B_. The location of _Service A_
is defined by the `service` entity for the request being proxied. The location
of _Service B_ is defined by the
`config.upstream_host`, `config.upstream_port`, and/or `config.upstream_uri` as
configured on the plugin.

There are 3 modes of operation:

1. Set a fixed percentage to be routed to _Service B_. See parameter
   `config.percentage`.
2. Define a whitelist or blacklist group comprised of Consumers with allowed or denied access to _Service B_.
   The Consumer-group association can be configured using the ACL plugin.
3. Set a period (in linear time) over which the traffic will be transferred
   from _Service A_ to _Service B_. See parameters `config.start` and
   `config.duration`.

### Determining Where to Route a Request

(This does not apply to whitelisting or blacklisting)

The Canary Release plugin defines a number of "buckets" (`config.steps`).
Each of these buckets can be routed to either _Service A_ or _Service B_.

For example: If you set `config.steps` to 100 steps, and `percentage` to 10%,
Canary will create 100 "buckets", 10 of which will be routed to _Service B_,
while the other 90 will remain routed to _Service A_.

The `config.hash` parameter determines which requests end up in a specific bucket.
When set to `consumer`, Canary ensures each Consumer will
consistently end up in the same bucket. The effect is that once a Consumer's bucket
switches to _Service B_, it will then always go to
_Service B_, and will not "flip-flop" between A and B. Alternatively if it is set to
`ip` then the same concept applies but on the basis of the originating IP address.

When using either the `consumer` or `ip` setting, if any specific Consumer or IP
is responsible for more than the average percentage of traffic, the migration
may not be evenly distributed, e.g., if the percentage is set to 50%, then 50% of
either the Consumers or IPs will be rerouted, but not necessarily 50% of the total requests.

When set to `none` the requests will be evenly distributed; each bucket
will get the same number of requests, but a Consumer or IP might flip-flop between
_Service A_ and _Service B_ on consecutive requests.

Canary provides an automatic fallback if, for some reason, a Consumer or IP can
not be identified. The fall-back order is be `consumer`->`ip`->`none`.

### Finalizing the Canary

Once the Canary is complete, either going to 100% for a percentage-based Canary,
or when the timed Canary has reached 100%, the configuration will need to be updated.
Note: if the plugin is configured on a `route`, then all routes for the current
`service` must have completed the Canary.

1. Update the `service` entity to point to _Service B_ by matching it to the URL as
specified by `config.upstream_host`, `config.upstream_uri`, and  `config.upstream_port`.
2. Remove the Canary plugin with a `DELETE` request.

Removing or disabling the Canary Release plugin before the Canary is complete will
instantly switch all traffic to _Service A_.


### Upstream Healthchecks

The configuration item `upstream_fallback` uses
[**Upstream Healthchecks**](/gateway/latest/admin-api/#upstream-objects)
to skip applying the Canary upstream if it does not have at least one healthy
target. For this configuration to take effect, the following conditions must be met:

 - As this configuration relies on Kong's balancer (and healthchecks),
 the name specified in `config.upstream_host` must point to a valid Kong Upstream
 object
 - [**Healthchecks**](/gateway/latest/reference/health-checks-circuit-breakers/) are
 enabled in the canary upstream, i.e., the upstream specified in `upstream_host`
 needs to have healthchecks enabled it. It works with both passive and active
 healthchecks.
