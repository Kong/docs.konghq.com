desc: Slowly roll out software changes to a subset of users
description: |
  Reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by slowly rolling out the change to a small subset of users. This plugin also enables roll back to your original upstream service, or shift all traffic to the new version.

### Usage

The plugin will route traffic to 2 different upstream services, referred to as A and B. The location of service A will be defined by the `upstream_url` property of the api the plugin is configured on. The location of service B is defined by the `config.upstream_host` or `config.upstream_uri` as configured on the plugin.

There are 2 modes of operation:

1. Set a fixed percentage to be routed to destination B. See parameter `config.percentage`.
2. Set a period over which (in linear time) the traffic will be moved over from destination A to B. See parameters `config.start` and `config.duration`.

### Determining where to route a request

The plugin defines a number of "buckets" (`config.steps`). Each of those can be routed to either A or B. For example: 100 steps, and `percentage` at 10%. Then 100 buckets will be created, of which 10 will be routed to upstream B, and 90 will remain at A.

Which requests end up in a specific bucket is determined by the `config.hash` parameter. When set to consumer then it is made sure that each consumer will consistently end up in the same bucket. The effect being that once a bucket a consumer belongs to is switched to B, it will then always go to B, and a `consumer` will not "flip-flop" between A and B. Alternatively if it is set to `ip` then the same concept applies, but based on the originating ip address.

The downside of `consumer` and `ip` is that if any specific consumer or ip is responsible for a more than average part of the load, the migration is not nicely distributed. Eg. with percentage set to 50%, then 50% of either the consumers or ips are rerouted, but not necessarily 50% of the requests.

When set to `none` then the requests will be nicely distributed, each bucket will get the same number of requests, but in this case a consumer or ip might be flip-flopping between destination A and B on consecutive requests.

In any case there is an automatic fallback in case a consumer or ip could not be identified for some reason. The fall-back order will be `consumer`->`ip`->`none`.

### Finalizing the canary

Once the canary is complete, either going to 100% for a percent-based canary, or after the timed canary reached 100%, the configuration needs to be updated.

This takes 2 steps:

1. Update location A to point to location B. This can be done by a PATCH request on the API where the `upstream_url` property is updated to the url as specified by `config.upstream_host` or `config.upstream_uri` (or location B).
2. Since now the location A and B are the same, the canary plugin can now be removed from the system with a `DELETE` request.

If the canary was not complete yet, then executing those steps prematurely, will instantly switch 100% of traffic to the new location (B).
