  Consumers and JWT secrets can be created with declarative configuration.

  Admin API endpoints that do POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE on secrets are not available on DB-less mode.
config:
  - name: uri_param_names
    required: false
    default: '`jwt`'
    datatype: set of string elements
    description: A list of querystring parameters that Kong will inspect to retrieve JWTs.
  - name: cookie_names
    required: false
    default: null
    datatype: set of string elements
    description: A list of cookie names that Kong will inspect to retrieve JWTs.
  - name: header_names
    required: false
    default: '`authorization`'
    datatype: set of string elements
    description: A list of HTTP header names that Kong will inspect to retrieve JWTs.
  - name: claims_to_verify
    required: false
    default: null
    datatype: set of string elements
    description: |
      A list of registered claims (according to [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519)) that Kong can verify as well. Accepted values: one of `exp` or `nbf`.
  - name: key_claim_name
    required: false
    default: '`iss`'
    datatype: string
    description: |
      The name of the claim in which the `key` identifying the secret **must** be passed. Starting with version `0.13.1`, the plugin will attempt to read this claim from the JWT payload and the header, in that order.
  - name: secret_is_base64
    required: true
    default: '`false`'
    datatype: boolean
    description: |
      If true, the plugin assumes the credential's `secret` to be base64 encoded. You will need to create a base64-encoded secret for your Consumer, and sign your JWT with the original secret.
  - name: anonymous
    required: false
    default: null
    datatype: string
    description:
      An optional string (consumer UUID or username) value to use as an “anonymous” consumer if authentication fails. If empty (default null), the request will fail with an authentication failure `4xx`. Note that this value must refer to the consumer `id` or `username` attribute, and **not** its `custom_id`.
    minimum_version: "3.1.x"
  - name: anonymous
    required: false
    default: null
    datatype: string      
    description: |
      An optional string (consumer UUID) value to use as an anonymous consumer if authentication fails.
      If empty (default), the request will fail with an authentication failure `4xx`. Note that this value
      must refer to the consumer `id` attribute that is internal to Kong Gateway, and **not** its `custom_id`.
    maximum_version: "3.0.x"
  - name: run_on_preflight
    required: true
    default: '`true`'
    datatype: boolean
    description: |
      A boolean value that indicates whether the plugin should run (and try to authenticate) on `OPTIONS` preflight requests. If set to `false`, then `OPTIONS` requests will always be allowed.
  - name: maximum_expiration
    required: false
    default: 0
    datatype: number
    description: |
      A value between 0 and 31536000 (365 days) limiting the lifetime of the JWT to `maximum_expiration` seconds in the future. Any JWT that has a longer lifetime is rejected (HTTP 403). If this value is specified, `exp` must be specified as well in the `claims_to_verify` property. The default value of `0` represents an indefinite period. Potential clock skew should be considered when configuring this setting.
