## Changes in this version

- New stat type: `distribution`
- New configuration options: `consumer_tag`, `status_tag`, `service_name_tag`

## Metrics
The Datadog plugin currently logs the following metrics to the Datadog server about a Service or Route.

Metric                     | Description | Namespace
---                        | ---         | ---
`request_count`            | tracks the request | kong.request.count
`request_size`             | tracks the request's body size in bytes | kong.request.size
`response_size`            | tracks the response's body size in bytes | kong.response.size
`latency`                  | tracks the time interval between the request started and response received from the upstream server | kong.latency
`upstream_latency`         | tracks the time it took for the final service to process the request | kong.upstream\_latency
`kong_latency`             | tracks the internal Kong latency that it took to run all the plugins | kong.kong\_latency

The metrics will be sent with the tags `name` and `status` carrying the API name and HTTP status code respectively. If you specify `consumer_identifier` with the metric, a tag `consumer` will be added.

### Metric fields

Plugin can be configured with any combination of [Metrics](#metrics), with each entry containing the following fields.

Field           | Description                                           | Datatypes   | Allowed values
---             | ---                                                   | ---         | ---
`name`          | Datadog metric's name                                 | String      | [Metrics](#metrics)
`stat_type`     | determines what sort of event the metric represents   | String      | `gauge`, `timer`, `counter`, `histogram`, `meter`, `set`, and `distribution`
`sample_rate`<br>*conditional*   | sampling rate                        | Number      | `number`
`consumer_identifier`<br>*conditional*| authenticated user detail       | String      | `consumer_id`, `custom_id`, `username`
`tags`<br>*optional*| List of tags                                      | Array of strings    | `key[:value]`

### Metric requirements

- All metrics get logged by default.
- Metrics with `stat_type` as `counter` or `gauge` must have `sample_rate` defined as well.

## Migrating Datadog queries
The plugin updates replace the api, status, and consumer-specific metrics with a generic metric name.
You must change your Datadog queries in dashboards and alerts to reflect the metrics updates.

For example, the following query:
```
avg:kong.sample_service.latency.avg{*}
```
would need to change to:

```
avg:kong.latency.avg{name:sample-service}
```

## Setting host and port per Kong node basis

When installing a multi-data center setup, you might want to set Datadog's agent host and port on a per Kong node basis. This configuration is possible by setting the host and port properties using environment variables.

{:.note}
> **Note:** `host` and `port` fields in the plugin config take precedence over environment variables.

Field           | Description                                           | Datatypes
---             | ---                                                   | ---
`KONG_DATADOG_AGENT_HOST` | The IP address or host name to send data to. | string
`KONG_DATADOG_AGENT_PORT` | The port to send data to on the upstream server | integer
