## Metrics
The Datadog plugin currently logs the following metrics to the Datadog server about a service or route.

Metric                     | Description | Namespace
---                        | ---         | ---
`request_count`            | tracks the request | `kong.request.count`
`request_size`             | tracks the request's body size in bytes | `kong.request.size`
`response_size`            | tracks the response's body size in bytes | `kong.response.size`
`latency`                  | tracks the time interval between the request started and response received from the upstream server | `kong.latency`
`upstream_latency`         | tracks the time it took for the final service to process the request | `kong.upstream_latency`
`kong_latency`             | tracks the internal Kong latency that it took to run all the plugins | `kong.kong_latency`

The metrics will be sent with the tags `name` and `status` carrying the API name and HTTP status code respectively. If you specify `consumer_identifier` with the metric, a tag `consumer` will be added.

### Metric fields

Plugin can be configured with any combination of [Metrics](#metrics), with each entry containing the following fields.

Field           | Description                                           | Datatypes   | Allowed values
---             | ---                                                   | ---         | ---
`name`          | Datadog metric's name                                 | String      | [Metrics](#metrics)
`stat_type`     | Determines what sort of event the metric represents   | String      | `gauge`, `timer`, `counter`, `histogram`, `meter`, `set` {% if_plugin_version gte:2.7.x %}, `distribution` {% endif_plugin_version %}
`sample_rate`<br>*conditional*   | Sampling rate                        | Number      | `number`
`consumer_identifier`<br>*conditional* | Authenticated user detail       | String      | `consumer_id`, `custom_id`, `username`
`tags`<br>*optional* | List of tags                                      | Array of strings    | `key[:value]`

### Metric requirements

- All metrics get logged by default.
- Metrics with `stat_type` as `counter` or `gauge` must have `sample_rate` defined as well.

## Migrating Datadog queries
The plugin updates replace the api, status, and consumer-specific metrics with a generic metric name.
You must change your Datadog queries in dashboards and alerts to reflect the metrics updates.

For example, the following query:
```
avg:kong.sample_service.latency.avg{*}
```
would need to change to:

```
avg:kong.latency.avg{name:sample-service}
```

{% if_plugin_version gte:2.6.x %}

## Setting host and port per Kong node basis

When installing a multi-data center setup, you might want to set Datadog's agent host and port on a per Kong node basis. This configuration is possible by setting the host and port properties using environment variables.

{:.note}
> **Note:** `host` and `port` fields in the plugin config take precedence over environment variables.

Field           | Description                                           | Datatypes
---             | ---                                                   | ---
`KONG_DATADOG_AGENT_HOST` | The IP address or hostname to send data to. | string
`KONG_DATADOG_AGENT_PORT` | The port to send data to on the upstream server. | integer

{% endif_plugin_version %}

## Changelog

**{{site.base_gateway}} 3.1.x**
* Added support for managing queues and connection retries when sending messages to the upstream with 
the `queue_size`,`flush_timeout`, and `retry_count` configuration parameters. 

**{{site.base_gateway}} 2.7.x**
* Added support for the `distribution` metric type.
* Allow service, consumer, and status tags to be customized through the configuration parameters `service_name_tag`, `consumer_tag`, and `status_tag`.

**{{site.base_gateway}} 2.6.x**
* The `host` and `port` configuration options can now be configured through the environment variables `KONG_DATADOG_AGENT_HOST` and `KONG_DATADOG_AGENT_PORT`.
This lets you set different destinations for each Kong node, which makes multi-DC setups easier, and in Kubernetes, lets you run a Datadog agent as a DaemonSet.
