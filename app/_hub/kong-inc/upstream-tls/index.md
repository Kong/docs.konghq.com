Upstream TLS can be added on top of an existing Service by executing the 
following request on your Kong server:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/services/1e6507e9-5c72-4dc2-9a3a-5131c4c5bea6/plugins \
    --form "name=upstream-tls" \
    --form "config.verify_mode=peer" \
    --form "config.trusted_certificates=@path_to_cert.pem" \
    --form "config.verify_depth=2"
```

`service`: the `id` or `name` of the Service that this plugin configuration will target.

It can also be applied globally (for every Route, Service, or API) using the
`http://kong:8001/plugins/` endpoint.

### Known Issues

PATCH requests to the `trust_certificates` configuration will not take affect until Kong is reloaded. This can be accomplished with the `kong reload` command.
