    **NOTE:** If the `config.http_endpoint` contains a username and password (for example,
    `http://bob:password@example.com/logs`), then Kong Gateway automatically includes
    a basic-auth `Authorization` header in the log requests.

## Log Format

Every request is logged separately in a JSON object (or array of JSON objects if
`queue_size` argument > 1) in the following format:

```json

    "request": {
        "method": "GET",

A few considerations on the above JSON object:

* `request` contains properties about the request sent by the client.
* `response` contains properties about the response sent to the client.
* `tries` contains the list of tries and retries (successes and failures) made by the load balancer for the request.
* `route` contains {{site.base_gateway}} properties about the specific Route requested.
* `service` contains {{site.base_gateway}} properties about the Service associated with the requested Route.
* `authenticated_entity` contains {{site.base_gateway}} properties about the authenticated credential if an authentication plugin has been enabled.
* `workspaces` contains {{site.ee_gateway_name}} properties of the Workspaces associated with the requested Route. **Only in {{site.ee_gateway_name}} version >= 0.34**.
* `consumer` contains the authenticated Consumer if an authentication plugin has been enabled.
* `latencies` contains some data about the latencies involved:
  * `proxy` is the time it took for the final service to process the request.
  * `kong` is the internal {{site.base_gateway}} latency that it took to run all the plugins.
  * `request` is the time elapsed between the first bytes were read from the client and after the last bytes were sent to the client. Useful for detecting slow clients.
* `client_ip` contains the original client IP address.
* `started_at` contains the UTC timestamp of when the request started to be processed.
