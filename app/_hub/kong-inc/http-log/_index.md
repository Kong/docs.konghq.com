        If the `http_endpoint` contains a username and password (for example,
        `http://bob:password@example.com/logs`), then Kong Gateway automatically includes
        a basic-auth `Authorization` header in the log requests.

## Queueing

The HTTP Log plugin uses internal queues to decouple the production of
log entries from their transmission to the upstream log server.  In
contrast to other plugins that use queues, it shares one queue
between all plugin instances that use the same log server parameter.
The equivalence of the log server is determined by the parameters
`http_endpoint`, `method`, `content_type`, `timeout`, and `keepalive`.
All plugin instances that have the same values for these parameters
share one queue.

> **Note:** If the `queue_size` argument > 1, a request is logged as an array of JSON objects.

## Custom Headers

The log server that receives these messages might require extra headers, such as for authorization purposes.

```yaml
...
  - name: http-log
    config:
      headers:
        Authorization: "Bearer <token>"
...
```
