name: Forward Proxy Advanced
publisher: Kong Inc.
version: 1.0.5
desc: Allows Kong to connect to intermediary transparent HTTP proxies
description: |
  The Forward Proxy plugin allows Kong to connect to intermediary transparent
   HTTP proxies, instead of directly to the upstream_url, when forwarding requests
   upstream. This is useful in environments where Kong sits in an organization's
   internal network, the upstream API is available via the public internet, and
   the organization proxies all outbound traffic through a forward proxy server.

### Notes

The plugin attempts to transparently replace upstream connections made by Kong
 core, sending the request instead to an intermediary forward proxy. Currently
  only transparent HTTP proxies are supported; TLS connections (via `CONNECT`)
  are not yet supported.
