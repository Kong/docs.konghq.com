        All HTTP requests going through the plugin will be tagged with a tracing HTTP request.
        This property codifies what kind of tracing header the plugin expects on incoming requests.
        Possible values are `b3`, `b3-single`, `w3c`, or `preserve`. The `b3` option means that
        the plugin expects [Zipkin's B3 multiple headers](https://github.com/openzipkin/b3-propagation#multiple-headers)
        on incoming requests, and will add them to the transmitted requests if they are missing from it.
        The `b3-single` option expects or adds Zipkin's B3 single-header tracing headers.
        The `w3c` option expects or adds W3C's traceparent tracing header. The `preserve` option
        does not expect any format, and will  transmit whatever header is recognized or present,
        defaulting to `b3` if none is found. In case of mismatch between the expected and incoming
        tracing headers (for example, when `header_type` is set to `b3` but a w3c-style tracing header is
        found in the incoming request), then the plugin will add both kinds of tracing headers
        to the request and generate a mismatch warning in the logs.
    - name: default_header_type
      required: true
      default: b3
      description: |
        Allows specifying the type of header to be added to requests with no pre-existing tracing headers
        and when `config.header_type` is set to `"preserve"`.
        When `header_type` is set to any other value, `default_header_type` is ignored.
    - name: static_tags
      required: false
      default: []
      value_in_examples:
      description: |
        The tags specified on this property will be added to the generated request traces. For example:
        `[ { "name": "color", "value": "red" } ]`.

## How it Works

When enabled, [this plugin](https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-zipkin) traces requests in a way compatible with [zipkin](https://zipkin.io/).

The code is structured around an [opentracing](http://opentracing.io/) core using the [opentracing-lua library](https://github.com/Kong/opentracing-lua) to collect timing data of a request in each of Kong's phases.
The plugin uses opentracing-lua compatible extractor, injector, and reporters to implement Zipkin's protocols.

### Reporter

An opentracing "reporter" is how tracing data is reported to another system.
This plugin records tracing data for a given request, and sends it as a batch to a Zipkin server using [the Zipkin v2 API](https://zipkin.io/zipkin-api/#/default/post_spans). Note that zipkin version 1.31 or higher is required.

The `http_endpoint` configuration variable must contain the full uri including scheme, host, port and path sections (i.e. your uri likely ends in `/api/v2/spans`).
