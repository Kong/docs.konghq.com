Applications allow registered developers on Kong Developer Portal to
authenticate against a Gateway service. Dev Portal admins can
selectively admit access to services using the
Application Registration plugin.

{:.note}
> **Note**: This plugin is for application registration in _self-managed_ 
> {{site.base_gateway}} instances.
> <br>
> <br>
> In {{site.konnect_short_name}}, the functionality is built in, so you 
> don't need this plugin. See the following documentation:
* [Learn about app registration in {{site.konnect_short_name}}](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/application-overview/)
* [Enable app registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/)

The Application Registration plugin is used in tandem with supported {{site.base_gateway}} authorization
plugins, depending on your configured Dev
Portal authorization provider. These authorization plugins use either {{site.base_gateway}} (`kong-oauth2`) or a third-party OAuth 
provider (`external-oauth2`) as the system of record (SoR) for application credentials. 

An authorization provider strategy **must be set** before configuring the Application Registration plugin. For more
information, see
[Configure an Authorization Provider Strategy](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/applications/auth-provider-strategy/).

Supported authorization plugins for use with application registration:

| {{site.base_gateway}} Plugin | Portal authorization strategy | Supported topologies |
|:------|:-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| [OAuth2](/hub/kong-inc/oauth2/) | `kong-oauth2` | Traditional |
| [Key Auth](/hub/kong-inc/key-auth/)| `kong-oauth2` | Traditional, hybrid, DB-less |
| [OIDC](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/)| `external-oauth2` | Traditional, hybrid, DB-less |

To learn how to set up key authentication, see [Enable Key Authentication for Application Registration](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/applications/enable-key-auth-plugin/).

If you plan to use the external OAuth option with OIDC, review the
[supported OAuth workflows](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/3rd-party-oauth/).
