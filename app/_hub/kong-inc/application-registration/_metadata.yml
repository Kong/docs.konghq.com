desc: Allow portal developers to register applications against Services
description: |

  Applications allow registered developers on Kong Developer Portal to
  authenticate against a Gateway Service. Dev Portal admins can
  selectively admit access to Services using the
  Application Registration plugin.

  {:.note}
  > **Note**: This plugin is for application registration in _self-managed_ Kong
  > Gateway instances.
  > <br>
  > <br>
  > In Konnect, the functionality is built into the Service Hub, so you don't need this plugin. See the following documentation:
  * [Learn about app registration in Konnect](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/application-overview/)
  * [Enable app registration](/konnect/dev-portal/applications/enable-app-reg/)

  The Application Registration plugin is used in tandem with supported Kong Gateway authorization
  plugins, depending on your configured Dev
  Portal authorization provider. Either Kong Gateway (`kong-oauth2`) or a third-party OAuth provider
  (`external-oauth2`) can be the system of record (SoR) for application credentials. For more
  information, see
  [Configure an Authorization Provider Strategy](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/applications/auth-provider-strategy/).

  To learn how to set up key authentication, see [Enable Key Authentication for Application Registration](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/applications/enable-key-auth-plugin/).

  Supported authorization plugins for use with application registration:

  | Kong Gateway Plugin | Portal authorization strategy                                 |
  |:------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | [OAuth2](/hub/kong-inc/oauth2/) | `kong-oauth2` |
  | [Key Auth](/hub/kong-inc/key-auth/)| `kong-oauth2` |
  | [OIDC](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/)| `external-oauth2` |

  If you plan to use the external OAuth option with OIDC, review the
  [supported OAuth workflows](/gateway/latest/kong-enterprise/dev-portal/authentication/3rd-party-oauth/).
