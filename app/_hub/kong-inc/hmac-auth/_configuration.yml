dbless_compatible: partially
dbless_explanation: |
  Consumers and Credentials can be created with declarative configuration.

  Admin API endpoints that do POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE on Credentials will not work on DB-less mode.
extra: |
  Once applied, any user with a valid credential can access the Service/Route.
  To restrict usage to only some of the authenticated users, also add the
  [ACL](/plugins/acl/) plugin (not covered here) and create allowed or
  denied groups of users.

desc: Add HMAC Authentication to your Services
description: |
  Add HMAC Signature authentication to a Service or a Route
  to establish the integrity of incoming requests. The plugin validates the
  digital signature sent in the `Proxy-Authorization` or `Authorization` header
  (in that order). This plugin implementation is based off the
  [draft-cavage-http-signatures](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-cavage-http-signatures)
  draft with a slightly different signature scheme.
