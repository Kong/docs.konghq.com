  extra: |

    Note that the `whitelist` and `blacklist` models are mutually exclusive in their usage, as they provide complimentary approaches. That is, you cannot configure the plugin with both `whitelist` and `blacklist` configurations. An `whitelist` provides a positive security model, in which the configured CIDR ranges are allowed access to the resource, and all others are inherently rejected. By contrast, a `blacklist` configuration provides a negative security model, in which certain CIDRS are explicitly denied access to the resource (and all others are inherently allowed).
