desc: Transform JSON objects included in API requests or responses using jq programs.
description: |
  The jq plugin enables arbitrary jq transformations on JSON objects included in API requests or responses.

  The configuration accepts two sets of options: one for the request and another for the response.
  For both the request and response, a jq program string can be included, along with some jq option flags
  and a list of media types.

  One of the configured media types must be included in the `Content-Type` header of
  the request or response for the jq program to run. The default media type in the `Content-Type`
  header is `application/json`.

  In the response context, you can also specify a list of status
  codes, one of which must match the response status code.
  The default response status code is `200`.

  {:.note}
  > **Notes:**
  > * In the response context the entire body must be buffered to be processed. This requirement also
  implies that the `Content-Length` header will be dropped if present, and the body transferred with chunked encoding.
  > * To use this plugin in Konnect Cloud,
    [upgrade your runtimes](/konnect/runtime-manager/upgrade) to at least
    v2.6.0.0.

  See jq's documentation on [Basic filters](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters) for more information on writing programs with jq.

        Boolean option flags to modify the run behavior of the jq program run on the request body.
        - `compact_output`: Returns output in a compact form without additional spacing,
          and with each JSON object on a single line. Defaults to `true`. Set to `false` for "pretty" output.
        - `raw_output`: Outputs as raw strings, not JSON quoted. Default is `false`.
        - `join_output`: Similar to `raw_output` but does not output newline separators. Default is `false`.
        - `ascii_output`: jq usually outputs non-ASCII Unicode codepoints as UTF-8, even if the input specified
           them as escape sequences (like `\u03bc`). Using this option, you can force jq to produce pure ASCII
           output, replacing every non-ASCII character with the equivalent escape sequence. Default is `false`.
        - `sort_keys`: Outputs the fields of each object with the keys in sorted order. Default is `false`.
