## Usage

### Set up an OPA server

If you are not already running an OPA server, start one by following instructions
on [openpolicyagent.org](https://openpolicyagent.org).

### Set up a dummy policy

Create an `example.rego` file with the following content:

```rego
package example

default allowBoolean = false
default allowDetailed = false


allowBoolean {
  header_present
}

header_present {
  input.request.http.headers["my-secret-header"] == "open-sesame"
}

allowDetailed = response {
  header_present
  response := {
    "allow": true,
    "headers": {
      "header-from-opa": "accepted",
    },
  }
}

allowDetailed = response {
  not header_present
  response := {
    "allow": false,
    "status": 418,
    "headers": {
      "header-from-opa": "rejected",
    },
  }
}
```

This policy allows the request to pass through if it contains the HTTP header
`my-secret-header` with value `open-sesame`.


Next, configure the policy with OPA:

```bash
curl -XPUT localhost:8181/v1/policies/example --data-binary @example.rego
```

The above command uses OPA's default port 8181. It could be different for your
setup.

### Set up {{site.base_gateway}}

Set up a Route and Service in {{site.base_gateway}} and then enable the plugin:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<admin-hostname>:8001/routes/<route>/plugins \
    --data "name=opa"  \
    --data "config.opa_path=/v1/data/example/allowBoolean" \
    --data "config.opa_host=<host-where-opa is running>"
```

### Make a request

Now, make a request to {{site.base_gateway}}:

```bash
curl http://kong:8000/{proxy_path}
```

You will get a 403 response from the gateway because OPA has rejected the request.

Next, make the same request providing the necessary header:

```bash
curl http://kong:8000/{proxy_path} \
  -H 'my-secret-header: open-sesame'
```

This time you will get the response from your upstream service, as this request
is allowed by OPA.

Next, update the plugin configuration to use `/v1/data/example/allowDetailed` as
`opa_path` and observe how the policy affects the response and proxied request.

## OPA input structure

The input to OPA has the following JSON structure:

```
{
  "input": {
    "request": { # details about the request from client to Kong
      "http": {
        "host": "example.org", # host header used by the client to make the request
        "port": "8000",        # port to which the request was made

## Expected response from OPA

After OPA is done executing policies, the plugin expects the policy evaluation
result in one of the defined formats: boolean or object. Any other format
or a status code other than `200 OK` results in the plugin returning a
`500 Internal Server Error` to the client.

### Boolean result

OPA can return a `true` or `false` result after a policy evaluation.
This should suffice for most use cases.

Examples:

To allow the request to be processed further, OPA should send the following
response:

```json
{
  "result": true
}
```

To deny the request and terminate its processing, OPA should send the following
response:

```json
{
  "result": false
}
```

Any other fields in the response in this case are ignored.

### Object result

In this case, OPA returns an object instead of a boolean result. This
allows for injecting custom HTTP headers as well as changing the HTTP status code
for rejected requests.

The plugin expects the following structure in the OPA response in this case:

```
{
  "result": {
    "allow": <boolean>,
    "status": <HTTP status code>,
    "headers": {
      "<key>": "<value>",
      "<key2>": "<value2>"
    },
    "message": "<value3> or object",
  }
}
```

The only required field in this response is `result.allow`, which accepts a
`boolean` value.

If `result.allow` is set to `true`, then the key-value pairs in `result.headers` (if any)
are injected into the request before it is forwarded to the upstream Service.

If `result.allow` is set to `false`, then the key-value pairs in `result.headers` (if any)
are injected into the response, the `result.message` (if any) is set as the response message,
and the status code of the response is set to `result.status`.
If `result.status` is absent then the default `403` status code is sent.
If `result.status` is absent, then the default *unauthorized* message is sent.
