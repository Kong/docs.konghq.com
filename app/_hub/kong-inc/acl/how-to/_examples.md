## ACL Configuration with Kong Gateway

In these examples, we will cover a common use case: As an API Owner, you want to regulate access based on the type of request methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and the consumer group (dev, admin) the consumer belongs to. Specifically, our goal is to allow consumers in the dev group to perform GET, POST, and PUT requests on all routes, while reserving the DELETE request functionality exclusively for consumers in the admin group.


### Create consumer groups 

Using the API, create two consumer groups named `dev` and `admin`: 

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url http://localhost:8001/consumer_groups \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --data '{"name":"dev"}'
```

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url http://localhost:8001/consumer_groups \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --header 'accept: application/json' \
     --data '{"name":"admin",}'
```

Then populate those consumer groups with consumers using the UUID of the specific consumer:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8001/consumer_groups/admin/consumers \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --data '{"consumer":"8a4bba3c-7f82-45f0-8121-ed4d2847c4a4"}'
```

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8001/consumer_groups/dev/consumers \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --header 'accept: application/json' \
  --data '{"consumer":"8a4bba3c-7f82-45f0-8121-ed4d2847c4a4"}'
```

### Create Routes 

Using the Admin API and the [expressions router](/gateway/latest/key-concepts/routes/expressions/) create two routes, one that matches `GET`, `POST` and `PUT`, and one that only matches `DELETE`. 

A route that matches when the method is _not_ `DELETE`
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8001/services/example-service/routes \
  --form-string name=devs-and-admins \
  --form-string expression='http.path == "/example" && http.method != "DELETE"'
```

A route that matches when the method _is_ DELETE
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8001/services/example-service/routes \
  --form-string name=only-admins \
  --form-string expression='http.path == "/example" && http.method == "DELETE"'
```


2. Setting up routes: Using Kong's expression router configure two routes â€“ one that matches GET, POST, and PUT requests, and another that exclusively matches DELETE requests. 

3. Setting up the ACL plugin: Associate the ACL plugin with each route, and specifying which consumers groups are allowed to access which routes. 

### Setup the ACL plugin

Scope the plugin to each of these routes with the respective `allow` configuration

The `devs-and-admin` route will have the `allow` field set to both of the groups

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/routes/devs-and-admin/plugins \
    --data "name=acl"  \
    --data "config.allow=dev"  \
    --data "config.allow=admin" \
```

The `only-admins` route will have the `allow` field set to only the `admin` group.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/routes/admins-only/plugins \
    --data "name=acl"  \
    --data "config.allow=admin" \
```
