desc: Control which Consumers can access Services
description: |
  Restrict access to a Service or a Route by adding Consumers to allowed or
  denied lists using arbitrary ACL group names. This plugin requires an
  [authentication plugin](/hub/#authentication) (such as
  [Basic Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/basic-auth/),
  [Key Authentication](/hub/kong-inc/key-auth/), [OAuth 2.0](/hub/kong-inc/oauth2/),
  and [OpenID Connect](/hub/kong-inc/openid-connect/))
  to have been already enabled on the Service or Route.

    Consumers and ACLs can be created with declarative configuration.

    Admin API endpoints that do POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE on ACLs will not work on DB-less mode.

  extra: |
    Note that the `allow` and `deny` models are mutually exclusive in their usage, as they provide complimentary approaches. That is, you cannot configure an ACL with both `allow` and `deny` configurations. An ACL with an `allow` provides a positive security model, in which the configured groups are allowed access to the resources, and all others are inherently rejected. By contrast, a `deny` configuration provides a negative security model, in which certain groups are explicitly denied access to the resource (and all others are inherently allowed).

### Usage

Before you use the ACL plugin, you need to have properly configured your Service or
Route with an [authentication plugin](/hub/#authentication)
so that the plugin can identify the client Consumer making the request.

#### Associating Consumers

{% navtabs %}
{% navtab With a database %}

After you have added an authentication plugin to a Service or a Route, and you have
created your [Consumers](/gateway-oss/latest/admin-api/#consumer-object), you can now
associate a group to a Consumer using the following request:

```bash
$ curl -X POST http://kong:8001/consumers/{consumer}/acls \
    --data "group=group1"
```

`consumer`: The `id` or `username` property of the Consumer entity to associate the credentials to.

form parameter        | default| description
---                   | ---    | ---
`group`               |        | The arbitrary group name to associate to the consumer.
{% endnavtab %}
{% navtab Without a database %}
You can create ACL objects via the `acls:` entry in the declarative configuration file:

``` yaml
acls:
- consumer: { consumer }
  group: group1
```

* `consumer`: The `id` or `username` property of the Consumer entity to associate the credentials to.
* `group`: The arbitrary group name to associate to the Consumer.
{% endnavtab %}
{% endnavtabs %}

You can have more than one group associated to a Consumer.

#### Upstream Headers

When a consumer has been validated, the plugin appends a `X-Consumer-Groups`
header to the request before proxying it to the Upstream service, so that you can
identify the groups associated with the Consumer. The value of the header is a
comma-separated list of groups that belong to the Consumer, like `admin, pro_user`.

This header will not be injected in the request to the Upstream service if
the `hide_groups_header` config flag is set to `true`.

#### Paginate through the ACLs

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This endpoint was introduced in Kong 0.11.2.
</div>

You can retrieve all the ACLs for all Consumers using the following
request:

```bash
$ curl -X GET http://kong:8001/acls

{
    "total": 3,
    "data": [
        {
            "group": "foo-group",
            "created_at": 1511391159000,
            "id": "724d1be7-c39e-443d-bf36-41db17452c75",
            "consumer": { "id": "89a41fef-3b40-4bb0-b5af-33da57a7ffcf" }
        },
        {
            "group": "bar-group",
            "created_at": 1511391162000,
            "id": "0905f68e-fee3-4ecb-965c-fcf6912bf29e",
            "consumer": { "id": "c0d92ba9-8306-482a-b60d-0cfdd2f0e880" }
        },
        {
            "group": "baz-group",
            "created_at": 1509814006000,
            "id": "ff883d4b-aee7-45a8-a17b-8c074ba173bd",
            "consumer": { "id": "c0d92ba9-8306-482a-b60d-0cfdd2f0e880" }
        }
    ]
}
```

You can filter the list by Consumer by using this other path:

```bash
$ curl -X GET http://kong:8001/consumers/{username or id}/acls

{
    "total": 1,
    "data": [
        {
            "group": "bar-group",
            "created_at": 1511391162000,
            "id": "0905f68e-fee3-4ecb-965c-fcf6912bf29e",
            "consumer": { "id": "c0d92ba9-8306-482a-b60d-0cfdd2f0e880" }
        }
    ]
}
```

`username or id`: The username or id of the Consumer whose ACLs need to be listed

#### Retrieve the Consumer associated with an ACL

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Note:</strong> This endpoint was introduced in Kong 0.11.2.
</div>

Retrieve a Consumer associated with an ACL
using the following request:

```bash
curl -X GET http://kong:8001/acls/{id}/consumer

{
   "created_at":1507936639000,
   "username":"foo",
   "id":"c0d92ba9-8306-482a-b60d-0cfdd2f0e880"
}
```

`id`: The `id` property of the ACL for which to get the associated
Consumer.
