name: Response Rate Limiting
dbless_compatible: partially
dbless_explanation: |
  The plugin will run fine with the `local` policy (which doesn't use the database) or
  the `redis` policy (which uses an independent Redis, so it is compatible with DB-less).

  The plugin will not work with the `cluster` policy, which requires writes to the database.

  In Konnect, DB-less, and hybrid modes, the <code>cluster</code> config policy
  is not supported.
  <br><br>
  For DB-less mode, use one of <code>redis</code> or <code>local</code>;
  for Konnect and hybrid mode, use <code>redis</code>, or <code>local</code> for data
  planes only.

desc: Rate-limiting based on a custom response header value
description: |
  This plugin allows you to limit the number of requests a developer can make
  based on a custom response header returned by the upstream service. You can
  arbitrarily set as many rate-limiting objects (or quotas) as you want and
  instruct Kong to increase or decrease them by any number of units. Each custom
  rate-limiting object can limit the inbound requests per seconds, minutes, hours,
  days, months, or years.

  If the underlying Service/Route has no authentication
  layer, the **Client IP** address will be used; otherwise, the Consumer will be
  used if an authentication plugin has been configured.
