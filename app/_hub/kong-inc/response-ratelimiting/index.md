publisher: Kong Inc.
version: 1.0.0

desc: Rate-limiting based on a custom response header value
description: |
  This plugin allows you to limit the number of requests a developer can make based on a custom response header returned by the upstream service. You can arbitrary set as many rate-limiting objects (or quotas) as you want and instruct Kong to increase or decrease them by any number of units. Each custom rate-limiting object can limit the inbound requests per seconds, minutes, hours, days, months or years.

  If the underlying Service/Route (or deprecated API entity) has no authentication layer, the **Client IP** address will be used, otherwise the Consumer will be used if an authentication plugin has been configured.

## Configuring Quotas

After adding the plugin, you can increment the configured limits by adding the following response header:

```
Header-Name: Limit=Value [,Limit=Value]
```

Since `X-Kong-Limit` is the default header name (you can optionally change it), it will look like:

```
X-Kong-Limit: limitname1=2, limitname2=4
```

That will increment the limit `limitname1` by 2 units, and `limitname2` by 4 units.

You can optionally increment more than one limit by comma separating the entries. The header will be removed before returning the response to the original client.

----

## Headers sent to the client

When this plugin is enabled, Kong will send some additional headers back to the client telling how many units are available and how many are allowed. For example if you created a limit/quota called "Videos" with a per-minute limit:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit-Videos-Minute: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Videos-Minute: 9
```

or it will return a combination of more time limits, if more than one is being set:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit-Videos-Second: 5
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Videos-Second: 5
X-RateLimit-Limit-Videos-Minute: 10
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Videos-Minute: 10
```

If any of the limits configured is being reached, the plugin will return a `HTTP/1.1 429` status code and an empty body.

### Upstream Headers

The plugin will append the usage headers for each limit before proxying it to the upstream service, so that you can properly refuse to process the request if there are no more limits remaining. The headers are in the form of `X-RateLimit-Remaining-{limit_name}`, like:

```
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Videos: 3
X-RateLimit-Remaining-Images: 0
```
