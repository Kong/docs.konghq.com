# Documentation Style Guide

### Admin, admin
Use proper case for the Kong entity, lowercase for the RBAC Role

* Invite the Admin using the Organization tab
* The default Roles are `super-admin`, `admin`, and `read-only`

### Admin API 
Use proper case

### Admin GUI
Use *Kong Manager* instead

### American English
Use American English throughout Kong documentation

### ampersands
Always use “and” in content, only use “&” in titles with two items that have always had it or in product names

### API
All upper case; if referring to an entity, use Services and Routes instead

### Basic Auth, Basic Authentication
Use proper case, abbreviate if the context permits. Only use lowercase with a hyphen in code/config samples

* Bad: Options include LDAP Auth and basic auth.
* **_Good_: Options include LDAP Auth and Basic Auth.**
* *Bad*: Ensure that `admin_gui_auth` is set to basic auth.
* **_Good_: Ensure that `admin_gui_auth` is set to `basic-auth`.**
* **_Good_: Ensure that `admin_gui_auth = basic-auth`.**


### click
Do not use “click on”; specify what is being clicked

* *Bad*: Click on “Admins”
* *Bad*: Look for one that says “Admins” and click
* **_Good_: Click the “Admins” button**

### cURL
Do not use CURL or curl

### e.g.
Indicates an inexhaustive list of examples, thus should not conclude with “etc.”; if offering a clarification, rather than an example, use “i.e.”. Following the Chicago Manual, follow each with a comma.

* *Bad*: Users may select a role, e.g. admin, read-only, etc.
* **_Good_: Users may select a role, e.g., admin, read-only.**
* *Bad*: The Role with the most RBAC permissions, e.g. the Super Admin.
* **_Good_: The Role with the most RBAC permissions, i.e., the Super Admin.**


### ellipses (...)
Indicates an incomplete thought, not a pause in a sentence; see em-dash

### em-dash (—)
Indicates a pause or emphatic break in a sentence; it's not a hyphen and has no surrounding space

* *Bad*: The admin role allows a user access to all endpoints... except for RBAC permissions.
* *Bad*: The admin role allows a user access to all endpoints - except for RBAC permissions.
* **_Good_: The admin role allows a user access to all endpoints—except for RBAC permissions.**

### explanatory guides
For explanatory sections, specify the value of the content, then provide clarification and examples. Avoid starting sections with casual or redundant information, e.g., “In this section, you'll learn how to do X.” For example, in a section titled “Negotiation with Pirates”:

* *Bad*: In this section, you will learn the reason for negotiating with pirates. Pirates may seem scary, but they can be reasoned with. Just match their body language and offer them some rum. From there, negotiation is self-explanatory. Now you know how to negotiate with pirates.
* **_Good_: Although pirates do not abide by the law, it is possible to come to a reasonable compromise with them. Their goal is financial gain, not a fight, and many of them were once merchant sailors. If it is not possible to deter them, it is best to maintain a friendly disposition. For the safety of your crew, keep their motivations in mind at all times during negotiation.**

### How-To Guides
Any section of documentation that is a guide involving multiple steps should have the following:

1. A title starting with “How to”
    * *Bad*: Creating New Admins in a Workspace
    * **_Good_: How to Create New Admins in a Workspace**
2. Numbered steps ranging from two to five; anything with more than five steps can be broken down into separate guides
3. Oriented towards a goal, not teaching; each step should be minimal and straightforward
    * detailed explanation may go in a separate section below the how-to guide, but should not interrupt it
    * *important* tags that prevent an undesired outcome may go at the bottom of a step, but should not be overused
4. Each step in a how-to guide should be identical to its TL;DR version--if any content is inessential, it can go into a blog post or a more appropriate section
