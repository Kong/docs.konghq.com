    # Kong Admin API

    Kong comes with an **internal** RESTful Admin API for administration purposes.
    Requests to the Admin API can be sent to any node in the cluster, and Kong will
    keep the configuration consistent across all nodes.

    - `8001` is the default port on which the Admin API listens.
    - `8444` is the default port for HTTPS traffic to the Admin API.

    This API is designed for internal use and provides full control over Kong, so
    care should be taken when setting up Kong environments to avoid undue public
    exposure of this API. See [this document][secure-admin-api] for a discussion
    of methods to secure the Admin API.

    ## Supported Content Types

    The Admin API accepts 2 content types on every endpoint:

    - **application/x-www-form-urlencoded**

    Simple enough for basic request bodies, you will probably use it most of the time.
    Note that when sending nested values, Kong expects nested objects to be referenced
    with dotted keys. Example:

    ```
    config.limit=10&config.period=seconds
    ```

    - **application/json**

    Handy for complex bodies (ex: complex plugin configuration), in that case simply send
    a JSON representation of the data you want to send. Example:

    ```json
    {
        "config": {
            "limit": 10,
            "period": "seconds"
        }
    }
    ```

        `host`, `port` and `path` individually.

        Services are associated to Routes (a Service can have many Routes associated
        with it). Routes are entry-points in Kong and define rules to match client
        requests. Once a Route is matched, Kong proxies the request to its associated
        Service. See the [Proxy Reference][proxy-reference] for a detailed explanation
        of how Kong proxies traffic.

      ]],
      details = [[
        See the [Precedence](#precedence) section below for more details.

        #### Precedence

        A plugin will always be run once and only once per request. But the
        configuration with which it will run depends on the entities it has been
        configured for.

        Plugins can be configured for various entities, combination of entities, or
        even globally. This is useful, for example, when you wish to configure a plugin
        a certain way for most requests, but make _authenticated requests_ behave
        slightly differently.

        Therefore, there exists an order of precedence for running a plugin when it has
        been applied to different entities with different configurations. The rule of
        thumb is: the more specific a plugin is with regards to how many entities it
        has been configured on, the higher its priority.

        The complete order of precedence when a plugin has been configured multiple
        times is:

        1. Plugins configured on a combination of: a Route, a Service, and a Consumer.
            (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
        2. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Consumer.
            (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
        3. Plugins configured on a combination of a Service and a Consumer.
            (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
        4. Plugins configured on a combination of a Route and a Service.
        5. Plugins configured on a Consumer.
            (Consumer means the request must be authenticated).
        6. Plugins configured on a Route.
        7. Plugins configured on a Service.
        8. Plugins configured to run globally.

        **Example**: if the `rate-limiting` plugin is applied twice (with different
        configurations): for a Service (Plugin config A), and for a Consumer (Plugin
        config B), then requests authenticating this Consumer will run Plugin config B
        and ignore A. However, requests that do not authenticate this Consumer will
        fallback to running Plugin config A. Note that if config B is disabled
        (its `enabled` flag is set to `false`), config A will apply to requests that
        would have otherwise matched config B.
