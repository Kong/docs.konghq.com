# KONG's Documentation Website

This repository contains the source content and code for [Kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong)'s documentation website. It's built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and deployed with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Here are some things to know before you get started:

* **We're beginner-friendly**. Whether you're a Technical Writer learning about docs-as-code or an engineer practicing your documentation skills, we welcome your involvement. If you'd like to contribute and don't have something in mind already, head on over to [Issues](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/issues). We've added `good first issue` labels on beginner-friendly issues.

* **We need more help in some areas**. We'd especially love some help with [plugin](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/tree/main/app/_hub) documentation.

* **Some of our docs are generated**.
    * [Admin API](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/)
    * [Configuration reference](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/configuration/)
    * [CLI reference](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/cli/)
    * [Upgrade guide](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/upgrading/)

All pull requests for these docs should be opened on the [Kong/kong](https://github.com/Kong/kong) repository.

For [Gateway Enterprise configuration reference](https://docs.konghq.com/enterprise/latest/property-reference/) and [PDK reference](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway-oss/latest/pdk/) documentation, open an issue on this repo and we'll update the docs.

* **Community is a priority for us**. Before submitting an issue or pull request, make sure to review our [Contributing Guide](https://docs.konghq.com/contributing/).

* We are currently accepting plugin submissions to our plugin hub from trusted technical partners, on a limited basis. For more information, see the [Kong Partners page](https://konghq.com/partners/).

## Generate the PDK, Admin API, CLI, and Configuration documentation
***

> This section is for Kong source code maintainers. You don't need to do anything here if you're contributing to this repo!

The PDK docs, Admin API docs, `cli.md` and `configuration.md` for each release are generated from the Kong source code.

To generate them, go to the `Kong/kong` repo and run:

```
scripts/autodoc <docs-folder> <kong-version>
```

For example:

```
cd /path/to/kong
scripts/autodoc ../docs.konghq.com 2.4.x
```

This example assumes that the `Kong/docs.konghq.com` repo is cloned into the
same directory as the `Kong/kong` repo, and that you want to generate the docs
for version `2.4.x`. Adjust the paths and version as needed.

After everything is generated, review, open a branch with the changes, send a
pull request, and review the changes.

You usually want to open a PR against a `release/*` branch. For example, in the
example above the branch was `release/2.4`.

```
cd docs.konghq.com
git fetch --all
git checkout release/2.4
git checkout -b release/2.4-autodocos
git add -A .
git commit -m "docs(2.4.x) add autodocs"
git push
```

Then open a pull request against `release/2.4`.

## Testing

Tests for this site are written using `rspec` and `capybara` with the `apparition` driver.

> You'll need Google Chrome installed to run these tests.

To run the tests, you must first build the site by running `make build` before running `make rspec`.

Many of the tests are smoke tests to check issues that occurred whilst adding caching to the site, such as ensuring that the side navigation isn't cached.

To add your own tests, look in the `spec` directory and use `home_spec.rb` as a sample. You specify which URL to visit and then a CSS selector to search for, before asserting that the contents match what you expect.

```ruby
it "has the 'Welcome to Kong' header" do
  visit "/"
  expect(find(".landing-page h1").text).to eq("Welcome to Kong Docs")
end
```

This test framework can also be used to test behavior added with JavaScript, but we do not have any examples at this time.

## Continuous Integration

We run various quality checks at build time to ensure that the documentation is maintainable.

### include-check

The `include-check.sh` script checks for any files in the `app/_includes` folder that depend on a `page.*` variable (e.g. `page.url`). This is not compatible with the `include_cached` gem that we use, and so using `page.*` in an include will fail the build.

> To run the script locally, open a terminal, navigate to the documentation
folder, and run `./include-check.sh`. If there is no output, everything is
successful.

In the following example, we can see that `deployment-options-k8s.md` uses a `page.*` variable, and that the include is used in the `kong-for-kubernetes.md` file:

```
‚ùØ ./include-check.sh
Page variables must not be used in includes.
Pass them in via include_cached instead

Files that currently use page.*:
File: app/_includes/md/2.5.x/deployment-options-k8s.md
via:
app/enterprise/2.5.x/deployment/installation/kong-for-kubernetes.md
```

Here are sample contents for those files:

In `kong-for-kubernetes.md`:

```
{% include_cached app/_includes/md/2.5.x/deployment-options-k8s.md }
```

In `deployment-options-k8s`:

```
This is an include that uses {{ page.url }}
```

To resolve this, the two files should be updated to pass in the URL when `include_cached` is called:


In `kong-for-kubernetes.md`:

```
{% include_cached app/_includes/md/2.5.x/deployment-options-k8s.md url=page.url }
```

In `deployment-options-k8s`:

```
This is an include that uses {{ include.url }}
```

The `include_cached` gem uses all passed parameters as the cache lookup key, and this ensures that all required permutations of an include file will be generated.

For guidelines on how to write includes and call them in target topics, see the
[Kong Docs contributing guidelines](https://docs.konghq.com/contributing/includes).
