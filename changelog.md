## Week 33

### [Feat: Document shared variables](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7750) (2024-08-13)

Update the template documentation to add details for using shared variables: 
https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/plugin-development/pdk/kong.ctx/#kongctxshared


This looks to have been added here, https://github.com/Kong/kong-plugin-request-transformer/pull/7, but we lack documentation on how to reference it. Using the documented convention, kong.ctx.shared.foo,  results in errors with "kong" being a nil value.

Tests have shown it successful  using this with the request transformer plugin and route transformer advanced, i.e:

x-name:$((function()     return shared["gruber"] end)())

Where "gruber" has been previously defined as
kong.ctx.shared.gruber = "myHeader"

### [Fix: Update key-auth request behaviour matrix](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7737) (2024-08-09)

I've read and re-read this section a few times - and I'm pretty sure there's a typo! But my apologies in advance if I've misunderstood the situation.

Kong will return a 401 when the API key is **not** known.

## Week 31

### [Fix: Add clarifying statement about private dev portals](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7708) (2024-07-31)

The prior sentence states that `and are discoverable on the internet` for Public Dev Portals. It seems like it would be good to  explicit that private are not (which is just an assumption I made)

### [Fix: Hardcode gateway version in centos doc](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7703) (2024-07-31)

As of 2.8.4.12, we are no longer building Centos packages for Gateway 2.8. Changing the variables on the 2.8 page to hardcoded so that they don't pick up a version of a package that doesn't exist. The version no longer needs to change dynamically with releases.

#### Modified

### [Feat: added release notes for new refresh button](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7701) (2024-07-30)

API Requests and Explorer now have a refresh button that allows users to manually refresh/fetch data without a full page site reload. It also preserves all filters.

### [Feat: Brotli support](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7692) (2024-07-31)

We added Brotli compression support in 3.6 but it was never documented. Adding a short doc on how to enable it.

Notes:
* I considered adding it to the Nginx directives doc, but there's nothing in there about configuring specific groups of directives for a goal - that topic is a more general thing. 
* I'm also not sure about putting this under "reference", but honestly, we don't really have a place for content like this at the moment.

### [Update: Add API instructions for finding Konnect hostnames](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7681) (2024-07-25)

Adding API instructions to find control plane and telemetry hostnames for Konnect control planes. Tested both regular and KIC control planes.

The headings on this page were also broken and didn't work as anchor links, as they were nested inside navtabs. This doesn't work, so I turned them into regular headings.

### [Fix: AI Proxy plugin: incorrect format in example](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7677) (2024-07-25)

The description of the example and the example itself don't refer to the same format: the description says `ollama` but the example uses `openai`. The correct format is `openai`, as the example also uses an Authorization header, which is required for `openai`.

Fixes https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/issues/7609.

## Week 27

### [chore(rate-limiting): clarify rate-limiting accuracy](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7607) (2024-07-03)

Both rate-limiting and rate-limiting-advanced plugins documentation specify that various policies are possible and states that `cluster` and `redis` are "Accurate". However it's possible to configure a `sync_rate` option for these plugins and set it to a value that does not offer synchronous behaviour allowing for some slippage in favor of performance.

This commit clarifies that `sync_rate` affects mentioned accuracy.

## Week 26

### [Feat: decK gateway CLI](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7585) (2024-06-27)

The decK gateway interaction commands were moved into a `gateway` subcommand in decK version 1.28.0, which also included some refactoring in how they function. At the time, we avoided updating the docs as users were unlikely to have a version of decK that uses those commands, and they were not yet stable. 
They are now ready to be updated, and the docs are causing more confusion by not using `deck gateway` in examples.

Took two different approaches re: versioning these commands:
* In the decK documentation (docs.konghq.com/deck), I version-tagged the commands whenever they were used in code blocks. If they were mentioned in text, I removed the `deck` portion.
  * Duplicated one file (docker run reference), as the whole page would've needed version tagging otherwise.
* In the rest of the site, I didn't version the commands, as there's no clear way to know what version of decK someone is using with a specific version of Gateway. All of the Gateway, Konnect, and plugin docs just use the `deck gateway` commands.

### [Update Konnect API links to point to latest](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7313) (2024-04-29)

Some links in our konnect docs point explicitly to v2 of various APIs, when they should be pointing to `latest` to remain evergreen. The only API where this is currently an issue is the identity API, as the latest version is now v3. Updating all versioned links to avoid this issue in the future.

Issue reported on slack.

### [Fix: Upstream URL for llama2 completion example](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7242) (2024-04-16)

The example provided in the curl command references the ollama endpoint, http://ollama-server.local:11434/v1/chat, which returns a 404.

Per the docs (referenced earlier on this page), the correct endpoint should be /api/chat which I can confirm works.

https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/api.md#generate-a-chat-completion

example:

$ curl localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{ "model": "llama2", "prompt":"Why does Kong make the best gateway?", "stream":false }' -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

$ curl localhost:11434/v1/generate -d '{ "model": "llama2", "prompt":"Why does Kong make the best gateway?", stream":false  }' -i
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Tue, 16 Apr 2024 01:56:56 GMT

404 page not found

## Week 12

### [fix: Update auth0 instructions to include warning on trailing forward slash in URL](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7122) (2024-03-22)

Updated the Issuer URL information, as providing a trailing slash will cause issues.


When we have trailing slash for issuer URL, it get concatenated which will result in issuer as this https://dev-26uur0y8i4n8x3ez.us.auth0.com//api/v2/". So, informing users via docs will be valuable until if this can be gracefully handled.

### [fix: Use consistent names in Mocking plugin example](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7116) (2024-03-22)

Fixes https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-3284.

Examples were using two sets of names, Ron and Jessica, and Hao and Sasha. The latter two are carried through the rest of the topic; the first two don't appear anywhere else, and feel like they might be left over from a previous version of the example .

### [Fix: Generate 3.6 Gateway kong.conf reference](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7115) (2024-03-21)

Regenerating the configuration reference for Gateway based on latest 3.6.1.1 patch. 
We didn't generate it with the release and there were significant changes to the file in that version. 
Now that these files are split out by version, this is easier to see. 

Also making some tweaks to run.lua and data.lua to use the same text that we have in the page description, and to remove a badge that doesn't need to exist.

Fixes https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-2889.

Will do the same for 3.5 with upcoming patch release (should be end of next week).

### [Chore: Update the 'No support available' plugins category and language](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7051) (2024-03-06)

For more accuracy, we are updating the category "No support available". We've had a lot of feedback from plugin owners that this category is misleading, because support is available, it's just not done by Kong.

Summary of changes:
* Category name and banner text: "No support available" -> "Contact 3rd party for support"
* Category in filter: "No support available" -> "Support by 3rd party" ("Contact 3rd party for support" doesn't fit in the space)
* URL slugs: 
  * "third-party" -> "third-party-partner" for tech partners - changed this for clarity
  * "none" -> "community" for 3rd party plugins that aren't partners
* Updates plugin templates to reflect the changes

### [Update: Add note about Google ACME and DNS requirement](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7047) (2024-03-05)

Added a couple of notes to clarify that a requirement is to also allow Google Trust Services (pki.goog) by adding a CAA DNS record in a situation where a domain is already explicitly using CAA DNS records. 

What is a little complicated by this is that if a domain doesn't include any CAA DNS records then it's all good, but if they even set one CAA DNS record then it implicitly denies all issuers that they did not define, requiring them to add a new one for `pki.goog` since that is the issuer we utilize in Konnect.

### [Feat: Convert navbar to dark theme](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/7022) (2024-03-04)

Converting navbar to dark theme and using new logos. 

I left the blue headers as-is mostly, and just had them fade into the navbar - I think that looks pretty good for the in-between stage.

I have asked the design team for what they expect from the expanded menu as well - leaving it as white for now, until they respond.

@fabianrbzg there's couple of things I couldn't figure out here, if you could take a look:
* Why the hover/interact state for the search bar looks... not so great. But I don't know how to find the source of the variable it's using for the hover state - looks like we're pulling it from somewhere else?
* Some issues with the mobile nav (see video) - can't figure out why the slideout overlaps with the nav while it's sliding:

### [DOCU-3662: improve plugin versioning](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6999) (2024-03-05)

Related [Jira ticket](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-3662)

Add support for `minimum_version` and `maximum_version` in
the frontmatter of plugin pages.

* If a page has one of these set in frontmatter, it gets generated
for that version range, similar to versions.yml
* If a page doesn’t have any minimum or maximum version,
it defaults to the setting for the whole plugin, which is set in versions.yml

The only caveat is that we had to replace `_metadata.yml` with a specific
`_metadata` folder. If a file for a specific version exists, (e.g.
`_metadata/_2.6.x.yml`) it will be used for that specific release, if
not `_metadata/_index.yml` will be used.

I also fixed a bug in the releases dropdown.
When switching to an older version for which the current page does not exist, it redirected the user to the plugin's landing page in its latest version instead of the version selected by the user.

1. You now create auth configs independently (instead of at the Org wide level) and apply them to the API Product versions of your choice

### [fix: Add 3.6 conditional rendering for single backup nodes](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6974) (2024-02-21)

We missed some conditional rendering for a note about single backup nodes. It should only apply to 3.6 and later? (waiting on confirmation for the correct version, so this PR might change a little)

Splits the top-level CRDs and the types that they rely on into separate sections to make it clear which types are meant to be used to create objects in the Kubernetes API.

It's propagated from the KIC repo: https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/5611

### [Fix a typo](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6925) (2024-02-08)

Fixed a mistake in attaching json data to curl command.  
The `=`, not `:`, must be used to attach the 'body'.

>       -d, --data <data>
>              (HTTP MQTT) Sends the specified data in a POST request to the HTTP server, in the same way that a browser does when a
>              user has filled in an HTML form and presses the submit button. This makes curl pass the data to the server using the
>              content-type application/x-www-form-urlencoded. Compare to -F, --form.
>
>              --data-raw is almost the same but does not have a special interpretation of the @ character. To post data purely
>              binary, you should instead use the --data-binary option. To URL-encode the value of a form field you may use
>              --data-urlencode.
>
>              If any of these options is used more than once on the same command line, the data pieces specified are merged with a
>              separating &-symbol. Thus, using '-d name=daniel -d skill=lousy' would generate a post chunk that looks like
>              'name=daniel&skill=lousy'.
>
>              If you start the data with the letter @, the rest should be a file name to read the data from, or - if you want curl
>              to read the data from stdin. Posting data from a file named 'foobar' would thus be done with -d, --data @foobar. When
>              -d, --data is told to read from a file like that, carriage returns and newlines are stripped out. If you do not want
>              the @ character to have a special interpretation use --data-raw instead.
>
>              The data for this option is passed on to the server exactly as provided on the command line. curl does not convert,
>              change or improve it. It is up to the user to provide the data in the correct form.
>
>              -d, --data can be used several times in a command line
>
>              Examples:
>               curl -d "name=curl" https://example.com
>               curl -d "name=curl" -d "tool=cmdline" https://example.com
>               curl -d @filename https://example.com
>
>              See also --data-binary, --data-urlencode and --data-raw. This option is mutually exclusive to -F, --form and -I,
>              --head and -T, --upload-file.
>               
>man curl

### [Refactor title tag generation](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6841) (2024-02-05)

[Jira ticket](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-3405)
Automate title tag generation.

It follows the following format:
```
H1 - <product> - <optional version> | site title
```

where:
* evergreen urls (/latest/) don't include the optional version
* if H1 contains <product> don't include - <product> - so we don't repeat text

### [Update: Change dev label and banner color](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6859) (2024-01-31)

Changing the "dev" label to "unreleased" to make it clearer what this doc version is supposed to be. 

Also changing the banner colour to red, as the previous banner looked too similar to the "outdated version" banner.

Some minor version/conditionals cleanup here as well.

### [Fix: kic - Use standard repository in Helm example instructions](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6842) (2024-01-26)

The KIC Helm install docs showed how to customise the image by using the nightly KIC image. This confused some users who actually tried to use the nightly image in a non-test environment.

### [Fix: Incorrect request format in DB-less and declarative config doc](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6837) (2024-01-26)

Corrected the command to send the config to the Gateway. It was using a GET instead of POST and when using form-urlencoded data (--data) it throws a 400 error.  

{"message":"declarative config is invalid: {error=\"failed parsing declarative configuration: 1:1: found character that cannot start any token\"}","name":"invalid declarative configuration","code":14,"fields":{"error":"failed parsing declarative configuration: 1:1: found character that cannot start any token"}}

This was changed to use multipart/form-data (--form)

### [Fix: Use config.scopes instead of config.scopes_required in OIDC okta guide](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6821) (2024-01-24)

The OIDC Okta guide incorrectly references `config.scopes_required` when it's actually configuring `config.scopes`.
Fixing that + some broken/outdated links + Dev Portal info that should be behind a conditional tag.
Also fixing the same links in the rest of the OIDC 3rd party guides.

### [DOCU-3511: Refactor version is](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6733) (2024-01-23)

Related [Jira ticket](https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-3511)

* Point jekyll-generator-single-source to the feature branch
* Set `latest: true` to the corresponding versions in `kong_versions.yml`
* Refactor Versions generators, we now have specific classes that handle
  setting the releases and versions information.
* Rename `app/_data/docs_nav_mesh_dev.yml` to
  `app/_data/docs_nav_mesh_2.6.x.yml`.
* Refactor Versions dropdown, we no longer need to maintain the routes
  and version info in the template.
* Don't include URLs from versions that are labeled to the sitemap
* Add `label: dev` to the unreleased version of mesh

### How it works

* We need to explicitly set `latest: true` to the corresponding versions in `app/_data/kong_versions.yml`
* For adding a new unreleased version, we need to add a new entry in `app/_data/kong_versions.yml`  with a label (it could be any string, e.g. `dev`, `next`, etc) and a new nav file, e.g. for gateway 

In `app/_data/kong_versions.yml`
```yaml 
- release: "3.5.x"
  ee-version: "3.5.0.2"
  ce-version: "3.5.0"
  edition: "gateway"
  latest: true # <- Set latest to the right version
  ...
- release: "3.6.x"
  ee-version: "3.6.0.0"
  ce-version: "3.6.0"
  edition: "gateway"
  label: dev # <- label the new unreleased version 
  ...
```
and we need to create the file `app/_data/docs_nav_gateway_3.6.x.yml`
The URLs generated for this version would be: `/gateway/dev/.../`, i.e. `/<edition>/<label or release>/...`.

Note that the file includes the actual release name in its name and not the label. 
This simplifies the release process. We just need to remove the `label` and set `latest: true` to it. 


### `page.release`

`page.release` is a [Liquid Drop](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Introduction-to-Drops) which is essentially an object that can be used in the templates (code [here](https://github.com/Kong/jekyll-generator-single-source/blob/82966bb101a62400839d35c06c0d406d5a1439d5/lib/jekyll/generator-single-source/liquid/drops/release.rb)). 

It's a replacement for `page.kong_version`, and whenever it is used in a template the [to_s](https://github.com/Kong/jekyll-generator-single-source/blob/82966bb101a62400839d35c06c0d406d5a1439d5/lib/jekyll/generator-single-source/product/release.rb#L45-L52) method gets called. It returns the release's label if it has one, or the release's value, e.g `3.4.x`.

It has a few other methods defined that should be useful:
* `value`: the actual release defined in `kong_versions.yml`, e.g. `3.4.x`.
* `label`: the name of the label.
* `latest?`: returns true if the release is marked as `latest` in `kong_versions.yml`.
* `versions`:  returns a hash with the corresponding versions defined in `kong_versions.yml`. For `gateway` it returns the versions without the suffix, i.e.  `{ 'ee' => '3.0.0.0', 'ce' => '3.0.0'  }`, for products that only have one version it returns a has with `default` as key, e.g. `{ 'default' => '2.6.x' }`.

The only time when we can't rely on the `to_s` method and we need to use `page.release.value` is when it is used as key when accessing hashes, like the [compatibility table](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/blob/8508a4d9479b73a40390af8eeae0ba65598f73c8/app/gateway/2.6.x/compatibility.md#L12).

### [Feat: Split+consolidate OIDC plugin docs into many guides](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6747) (2024-01-16)

#### Summary
Big OpenID Connect doc consolidation + split out how-to guides + cleanup.
https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-3384

Changes in this PR:
* Moving the OpenID Connect guides that are buried in Gateway into the OIDC plugin doc
* Splitting out all the flow guides into their own pages for better discoverability/navigation
* Keycloak + gateway setup are now collapsible prereq sections that we can reuse in every OIDC demo
* Cross-linking to all the other OIDC content that's scattered all over our docs, for all the bits where OIDC is used internally
* Remade all the diagrams with mermaid.js; deleted all the images that are no longer in use

The scope of the work is scaled back here somewhat to get this project moving. Not doing yet:
* Use opinionated examples in how-to guides
* Convert everything httpie into curl
* All the testing
* All the cleanup

### [Update: Prerequisite to review version compatibility before Gateway upgrade](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6740) (2024-01-10)

Customer noted that the instructions to review OS compatibility are buried too deeply within the upgrade guide, and they missed them on their first read through the guide.

Adding the links/instructions to review compatibility as the first step, as no upgrade can be performed if your system doesn't support it.

### [Update: Rework style guide and add guidelines for writing recommendations](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6717) (2024-01-08)

The Kong docs style guide was missing info on writing recommendations. I ran into some phrasing during a review and wanted to reference our guide, and realized that we never documented it (even though [we did discuss it and decided on a style](https://konghq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KD/pages/2797568009/Standards+and+guidelines#:~:text=Standardize%20recommendations)).

Also took this opportunity to split up the "best practices" table into separate sections and add more info. 
* One of the main benefits of having a style guide is being able to link to specific guidelines, and that table made it difficult to do that + didn't have room to add more explanation. 
* As well, when you scrolled past a certain point, you couldn't tell which column was "Do" and which was "Do not" anymore.
* Removed the "Not british english" phrase from the language section. Seemed strange that we were singling out just British English, and there's no sense in trying to exhaustively list all varieties of English that are docs are not.
* Did some reorganization.

Fixing by splitting out `if_version` tags, so that they don't encompass part of a still-existing section. The previous approach is harder to maintain + causes these spacing issues.

### [Fix: Remove inaccurate note and links about decK in db-less mode doc](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6633) (2023-12-08)

decK is not meant for DB-less mode, since it uses the Admin API to manage configs. There was some inaccurate info in the docs about this, suggesting that decK _can_ be used for DB-less. Removing that and adding a note on the difference between declarative and decK config.

Issue reported on Slack.

### [Add a step to publish API Product and version docs](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6620) (2023-12-07)

To address this issue, I am adding an extra step that instructs users on how to publish their API Product and version documentation.

### [Fix: Azure vault env variables](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6595) (2023-12-04)

To set any environment variables to configure Kong Gateway (kong.conf), each env variable must be prefixed with `KONG_`. These prefixes, along with the `VAULT` portion of each config parameter, are missing from the example codeblocks in the Azure Vaults doc.

See https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/reference/configuration/#vault_azure_vault_uri for the relevant parameter names, which all start with `vault`.

### [Fix broken links](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6553) (2023-11-27)

Just ran it locally and got this:
```json

```

I'm not 💯 sure about these changes though, so please review them carefully.

  I don't think that `/kubernetes-ingress-controller/VERSION/concepts/deployment/: /kubernetes-ingress-controller/VERSION/production/deployment-topologies/` is the right call here, I couldn't find anything remotely similar to it though. We might want to update the `Note` though.

  ``` json

    "text": "Using Kong Gateway Enterprise",
    "target": "http://localhost:8888/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/guides/choose-gateway-image/",
    "reason": "HTTP_404"
  }
  ```
  This guide no longer exists in KIC v3.

* 
  ```json
  {
    "page": "http://localhost:8888/gateway/latest/how-kong-works/routing-traffic/",
    "text": "Router Expressions language",
    "target": "http://localhost:8888/gateway/latest/reference/router-expressions-language/",
    "reason": "HTTP_404"
  }
  ```
  `reference/router-expressions-language` was removed in [this PR](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6437/files#diff-6a9b955367a5ba2f6c4ad05d0a6feb8ad5980ef1aa26806e074a53c5437c7cba) and most of the references were updated but not all.

* 
  ```json
    {
      "page": "http://localhost:8888/gateway/latest/production/monitoring/readiness-check/",
      "text": "Get Started with Kong Ingress Controller",
      "target": "http://localhost:8888/kubernetes-ingress-controller/latest/deployment/overview/",
      "reason": "HTTP_404"
    }
  ```
  In KIC v3 there's no `deployment/overview`. I couldn't find a similar page though.

This also ignores `linux.die.net`, for some reason it returns `HTTP_403` in the CI - not locally though.

### [fix: add the missing part of kong gateway vault's secrets versioning description](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6551) (2023-11-30)

The PR adds the missing part of Kong Gateway Vault's secrets versioning description.

Gateway's vault supports accessing versioning secrets by specifying version number as a fragment in the vault reference URL.

Note that this is not a new feature added recently, it exists long time ago, only the doc part is missing.

### [Update: Listing a license requires license added via Admin API to begin with](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6547) (2023-11-27)

We've had a few customer support cases where customers are confused by a null response from the /licenses endpoint when they're not actually using the Admin API to load the license in the first place which is a requirement for this to work properly. When using an environment variable to set the license instead, the /licenses endpoint will not work for listing licenses. This PR is to make this clearer in the documentation.

### [feat: Portal Management API documentation](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6519) (2023-11-28)

For Reviewers this needs: 

* Testing
* Copy Edit
* Narrative structure review

Questions: 
* The original draft has another section, I have some of it commented out, I felt like what I had ended pretty nicely and in combination with a blog and a spec could make a complete package but let me know if you don't agree. 
* I tried to write a purpose statement, does it answer it?

AC: 
This doc helps portal administrators and developers understand how to integrate the API into their workflow for tasks like automating approvals, assigning permissions, and monitoring developer activity.

### [chore: improve docs about support of gRPC in KIC](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6497) (2023-11-15)

Improve documentation for gRPC support in KIC
- as long as https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4273 is not resolved only gRPC over HTTPS is supported, so mention it
- remove the redundant annotation `konghq.com/protocol: grpcs` from the service, because in [examples/gateway-grpcroute.yaml](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/blob/314951c3279dcd38cb7de7e53f71969379a0340a/examples/gateway-grpcroute.yaml#L5-L17) it's not specified and that configuration is tested in KIC CI so it works

## Week 44

### [Fix: 2.8.1.3 changelog entry for aws-lambda plugin changes to match 3.0.0.0](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6440) (2023-11-02)

Copied the text written in 3.0.0.0 changelog entry for the aws-lambda plugin to when it was introduced in 2.8.1.3 for consistency. Makes it easier to find the versions in which those properties were added for `aws_assume_role_arn` for example.

### [Fix: App registration doc lists hybrid mode as not supported](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6416) (2023-11-02)

We've had the same wrong info in the app registration docs since 2.1.x: that when using Kong Gateway as the system of record, app reg can't be used in hybrid mode. This issue recently resurfaced as a customer ran into it. 

Changes made:
* Removing the inaccurate info and making it clear that the limitation is for the OAuth2 plugin only. 
* Added a column to the table in the App Reg plugin overview with info about supported topologies, to make it very clear up front.
* Cleaning up the app reg auth provider strategy docs to remove all the duplicate info and cut the content down to what the user needs to know. We have the same info repeated three times in one topic, making it very difficult to actually follow along with any instructions. 
* Removed outdated images from the edited topics.

Backported it back through 2.6 since it was just a matter of copy & paste.

### [fix(opentelemetry): address invalid request to set up plugin](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6406) (2023-10-30)

The request documented to configure the Opentelemetry plugin is invalid because it uses a dot `.` in the name of the attribute, which is interpreted as a field separator in the curl form data.

This updates the documentation without changing the example, using JSON instead of form data to allow passing a name that includes a dot.

The PR adds all of them.

### [Add GWAPI redirect instructions](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6335) (2023-10-27)

Add GWAPI instructions to the KIC HTTPS redirect guide. Due to https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4890 this uses our vendor annotations.

Adds a TLS configuration include. This creates a certificate and injects configuration to use it into either an Ingress or Gateway. The certificate hostname is configurable. The Gateway and Ingress names are not and expect the standard `echo` Ingress or `kong` Gateway.

GWAPI does not easily allow adding HTTPS configuration without a TLS Listener, and these Listeners _must_ have a certificate as of GWAPI v0.8. We can't use the default Kong certificates if we don't care about the specific certificates, so we need this include for any guides that touch HTTPS-specific functionality.

### [Fix: Kong Gateway support matrix](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6326) (2023-10-17)

Fixing the following issues with the [Kong Gateway support matrix](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/support-policy/):
* PostgreSQL 9 and 10 are no longer supported by upstream but our docs claim to support them. Also, PostgreSQL 11 is also going out of support in 3 weeks
* Our support policy doc incorrectly stated the EOLs of many OSes. We have this statement (adjusted for dates/versions) at the top of every version's support table:

  " Kong Gateway 2.8 LTS supports the following deployment targets until March 2025, unless otherwise noted by an earlier OS vendor end of life (EOL) date." 

  However, our support tables aren't listing the accurate "earlier OS vendor end of life (EOL) dates".

* The support table inaccurately lists available Docker images. We have many new Docker images available now that weren't listed (especially for 2.8 LTS).
  
  As I was trying to figure out which versions we have images for, I also noticed that the base OS for our convenience images changed once again in 3.2.1.0. It originally switched from Alpine to Debian in 3.0.0.0, which is already in the changelog, but we were unaware of the switch to Ubuntu later. Added a changelog entry for that.

### [feat(multiple-metrics): updated latency section and images](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6319) (2023-10-19)

Updated content to support our new multiple metrics feature hopefully coming out by the end of this week. In details:
* Updated latency use case section to only cover how to compare upstream vs kong latency. Previously, we had two separate section but you don't need to create two individual reports anymore.
* Updated all images to cover UI changes.

### [Fix: curl examples for custom plugins schemas in Konnect](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6252) (2023-10-10)

Turns out that you can't pass a file directly via cURL to our Konnect CP configuration API. The contents of the file don't get escaped correctly. When testing this out originally, I used a mix of cURL and HTTPie, and HTTPie had no issues - but our default cURL instructions have problems here.

Issue was reported on [Slack](https://kongstrong.slack.com/archives/C03NRECFJPM/p1696622470557839).

Updating the doc with Fero's help, tested it all with curl this time around.

The jq instructions are in a "tip", since we can't tell them to use jq if they don't want to or don't have it.

* Unsupported community plugins: Plugins from contributors that haven't gone through the above process.

This update makes it clearer which is which by using better filtering, banners, and categorization.

Badges & their tooltips are currently misaligned on h2-h5s:

<img width="773" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-05 at 1 45 43 PM" src="https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/assets/54370747/5ea03aa5-02e9-4b9d-b6b1-f26bd758285b">

This PR fixes the alignment for both.

While testing out the fix, I also noticed that we had some wrong badges applied to the Konnect section of the Gateway intro page. We got rid of Plus and Enterprise badges for Konnect with the switch to consumption-based billing, since it isn't accurate to apply either tier to features in Konnect anymore.

### [Chore: Consistent banners/callouts across docs site](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6190) (2023-09-28)

We have a lot of different alert/callout/banner styles across the docs site. They are a mix of two styles:

* `alert` div elements and all of their classes and subclasses
* `blockquote` elements with a few different classes

The `alert` div is the old method, where we used html tags in the docs. The `blockquote` method is what we use now, where we can use markdown and apply a banner class like this:

```
{:.note}
> This is my note.


{:.note .no-icon}
> This is my note without an icon.
```

The issue is that the CSS styling for the old and new elements keeps growing wider apart, as changes are made to the blockquote and not to the alert. This became far more obvious after the site redesign, where we ended up with lot of different font sizes and spacing issues in banners:

Inconsistent styling using `alert`:
<img width="793" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 2 41 14 PM" src="https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/assets/54370747/b4cc0514-5516-4c57-b3c1-54f3f62d6c85">

Consistent styling using markdown and blockquotes:
<img width="781" alt="Screenshot 2023-09-27 at 2 41 55 PM" src="https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/assets/54370747/e02c81ac-6478-4fdc-8cb6-a21a4e71812e">

If we want to adjust styling after this, we should do so based on the blockquote element.

### [fix: MinK control plane diagram](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6187) (2023-09-27)

The original diagram showed zones and ingress/egress as being Konnect managed, which was incorrect. This PR corrects it since only the global control plane is managed by Konnect.
 
Fixes #6180

### [Feat: Add tool that detects broken markdown anchors](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6111) (2023-09-28)

Add a new tool that detects output of ` [.+][.+] ` in the `dist` folder. These are markdown links where the anchor at the bottom of the file could not be found.

#6101 is a good example of where this happens

### [Feat(api-requests): Added API requests beta to docs](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6104) (2023-09-26)

Added a new section under Analytics to document our upcoming API Requests feature. This feature is in beta. Please take a look at [this release](https://konghq.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KNN/pages/3065151570/API+Requests+Beta) minutes page to learn more about this feature.

### [doc(portal): add documentation for auth0 dcr metadata TDX-3342](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6096) (2023-09-26)

Adds documentation around auth0 metadata, and how to use it via an action.

### [Update: Sectioned cluster_fallback configs + added WebAssembly text to Wasm section](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6065) (2023-09-27)

Moved the DP Resilience feature (Cluster Fallback) properties to their own section for better organization and linking. Loosely related to https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6064.

Also noticed our Wasm section had no reference to the text 'WebAssembly' which resulted in it not being found easily. Added that to the title of that section to allow for better searchability.

### [Update: Konnect audit log webhooks only allow HTTPS](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6142) (2023-09-20)

Konnect Audit Webhook Configurations only allow HTTPS endpoints - HTTP endpoint traffic will blocked at network level. Hence, updated docs to reflect same.

### [fix(dcr): Note about Azure DCR v1 endpoints](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6126) (2023-09-20)

We wanted to add [a small note](https://kongstrong.slack.com/archives/C05HHGAPYJU/p1695033542245779) about Azure DCR only supporting v1 endpoints.

### [Feat: Konnect Great Rename](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6121) (2023-09-20)

The “runtime” terminology has become overloaded and not meaningful to users. Since the conception of Konnect, users have struggled with understanding the “runtime group” and “runtime instances” terms and how they match up with the gateway topology.

With this rename, kong-ified terms such as “runtime” are replaced with more standardized terminology such as control plane and data plane. As a result, new users to Konnect should have an easier time understanding and navigating the Konnect UI and APIs.

https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-3151

#### Summary of changes

UI:
* Runtime Manager to Gateway Manager
* Runtime group to control plane
* Composite runtime group to control plane group
* Runtime instance to data plane node

API:
* `/v2/systems-accounts` to `/v3/system-accounts`
* `/v2/teams` to `/v3/teams`
* `/v2/users` to `/v3/users`
* `/v2/roles` to `/v3/roles`
* `/v2/runtime-groups` to `/v2/control-planes`
* `/v2/runtime-groups/{runtimeGroupId}/` to `/v2/control-planes/{controlPlaneId}/`
* `/v2/runtime-groups/{runtimeGroupId}/composite-status` to `/v2/control-planes/{controlPlaneId}/group-status`

decK:
* decK command flag: `--konnect-runtime-group-name` to `--konnect-control-plane-name`
* decK state file attribute: `_konnect.runtime_group_name`  to` _konnect.control_plane_name`

### [Update: Add note about group filtering to Konnect SSO](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6119) (2023-09-20)

Just adding a note to the Konnect SSO doc page about group filtering as it's needed in the rare case where a user in the IdP has over ~150 groups assigned which some IdPs will then not send the groups_claim in a standard manner and prevents successful authentication as a result. Customers need to use group filtering capabilities from the IdP to work effectively in that situation.

Stems from an issue discussed in Kong Support case #00037499.

## Week 37

### [Update(plugins): GraphQL Introspection endpoint related note](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6090) (2023-09-12)

GraphQL Introspection endpoint will only be read from the Kong service (`service = ngx.ctx.service`) instead of reading from a specific variable or ingress - local.

Documenting this behavior so consumers are aware of how to configure correctly and know about the limitation.

#### Modified

### [[Fix]- KIC: Setting up Active and Passive health checks guide](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6081) (2023-09-11)
 
Revised and rewrote the guide after validating.

### [fix missing keyword config in curl data](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6075) (2023-09-12)

To enable grpc-web plugin via Admin API, the keywork `config` in curl data is missing.

### [fix: remove unsupported KIC feature](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6068) (2023-09-11)

Remove the custom entities guide from KIC 2.x pages.

This feature was never actually supported in 2.x, and we removed the leftover flag [in 2.9](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3262). In earlier 2.x versions, the flag was available but did not work.


## Week 36

### [chore: Split the gateway changelogs to archive changelogs for sunset versions](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6073) (2023-09-08)

Our Gateway changelog page is massive. This is a problem for everyone involved:
* Bad page load times/performance
* Difficult to edit
* Lots of unnecessary info
* Documenting versions that we don't support
* And the most recent discovery, a not-insignificant chunk of our Algolia records

From now on, we will be archiving old changelogs at the same time we archive old versions of our docs. You can find the changelogs at https://legacy-gateway--kongdocs.netlify.app/enterprise/changelog/.

### [update urls to latest and remove mention of dev portal](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6066) (2023-09-06)

Update urls to latest for gateway APIs.

Remove mention of dev portal from API announcement banner.

### [Fix(plugin scopes): Consumer groups scope and application registration plugin](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6059) (2023-09-05)

The [scopes compatibility table](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/plugins/compatibility/#scopes) was missing a column for consumer groups. This update enables generating the column and all entries from the plugins' schemas.

Additionally, the Application Registration plugin was listed as incompatible with all scopes, which is wrong - it's compatible with services only. Turns out we were selecting for the wrong key. Fixing this also fixes the display of the plugin's [config](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/application-registration/configuration/) and [basic examples](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/application-registration/how-to/basic-example/), which were both missing services.

### [feat: Split serverless plugins into their own pages](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6047) (2023-09-08)

We currently document one entry for [Serverless Functions](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/serverless-functions/), but it’s actually two plugins: `pre-function` and `post-function`. When searching for docs, users look for one of those names, not for Serverless Function. The UI also has them as two separate plugins, so one docs entry doesn't make sense.

This PR aims to solve that by splitting Serverless Functions into Post-function and Pre-function plugins. 
* For the titles of the plugins, used the names from the Konnect and Kong Manager UIs: Kong Functions (Pre-Plugins) and Kong Functions (Post-Plugins).
* You can still search for these plugins by the term "serverless" and by their real names (post- and pre-function)
* Split out the how-to guide for the pre-function plugin into its own topic
* For the post-function plugin, wrote a how-to guide based on a KB: https://support.konghq.com/support/s/article/How-can-the-latency-and-rate-limit-plugin-header-names-be-changed
* For both plugins, also added short guide on running the plugins in multiple phases based on yet another KB: https://support.konghq.com/support/s/article/Is-it-possible-to-run-serverless-plugins-in-phases-other-than-the-access-phase

### [fix: change go-apiops to deck file in deck_file_remove-tags.md](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6037) (2023-09-06)

go-apiops cli is built for testing purposes. End users are encumbered to use this utility through deck file command

I changed `go-apiops` cli example to `deck file`. As mentioned in [go-apiops repository](https://github.com/Kong/go-apiops)
> Currently, the functionality is released as a library and as part of the [decK](https://github.com/Kong/deck) CLI tool. The 
> repository also contains a CLI named go-apiops **for local testing**. For general CLI usage, prefer the decK tool [docs](https://docs.konghq.com/deck/latest/) tool.

 `go-apiops` is used for testing and deck is encouraged for general usage.

### [Edited the CP outage handling doc to add emphasis to environment variables](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6022) (2023-08-28)

Corrected some wording and bolded the "import" and "export" portions in the environment variables as customers are often seeing these are the same variables without realizing they're different between export and import.

Reverted the bolding after I realized it didn't load correctly in the preview. Overall the final change is just a mild correction to a wrongly formatted sentence from earlier.

### [feat(pre-built-reports): added changelog entry and an intro sentence](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6009) (2023-08-28)

Added a changelog item to release our pre-built reports feature ([Aha ticket](https://konghq.aha.io/features/KP-204)) and an intro sentence into the Analytics section inside the Konnect intro chapter. This feature is rather small and is only for new organization. Therefore, I think we don't need a lot of docs changes.

### [chore: Sunset Kong Gateway versions 2.1.x-2.5.x](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/5992) (2023-08-29)

As of August 24th, 2023, Kong Gateway OSS and Enterprise versions 2.1.x-2.5.x [end their sunset support](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/latest/support-policy/#older-versions).

This PR removes all of the old versions from the docs site, as well as the `/archive` folder maintained on the `main` branch.
We no longer need that folder, since we have a legacy-gateway site.

You can find all of the archived versions at the following links:
https://legacy-gateway--kongdocs.netlify.app/enterprise/2.5.x/
https://legacy-gateway--kongdocs.netlify.app/gateway-oss/2.5.x/
https://legacy-gateway--kongdocs.netlify.app/getting-started-guide/2.5.x/overview/

For the additions to the archive, see https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/5993.

https://konghq.atlassian.net/browse/DOCU-3347

---

Some specifics:
* Deleting everything to do with `enterprise`, `gateway-oss`, and `getting-started-guide` editions and URLs. All three of those editions were replaced with one `gateway` edition in 2.6.x. Since we're archiving everything before 2.6.x, we no longer need to maintain all of the exceptions for the old editions.
* Plugins: We will no longer build versions 2.5.x or earlier. There wasn't a lot of 2.5.x or earlier content that was unique, so I think that should be fine.
  * If we want to move the old plugin docs to the archive site, we will need to port the whole new plugin hub over there. I'm not sure that it's worth it yet.

## Week 34

### [Fix missing icon](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6007) (2023-08-25)
 
The OSS/Enterprise icon was missing. We changed it to a white version when we added it to the blue navigation, and forgot to change it back when we put it back in the TOC. 

Add missing `alt` text to konnect's dashboard image.

### [fix: Add missing metadata to appdynamics and serverless functions plugins](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/5999) (2023-08-24)

The AppDynamics and Serverless functions plugins were incorrectly listed as being incompatible with all Kong Gateway deployment modes: https://docs.konghq.com/hub/plugins/compatibility/#serverless

Fixing that by adding `network_config_opts` to the metadata files for both plugins. Both plugins can be run in DB-less, traditional, and hybrid modes.

### [feat: Konnect API examples for plugins](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/5970) (2023-08-23)

For any plugin that is supported in Konnect, it’s now possible to configure it using the Konnect runtime groups API, via `core-entities`. This PR adds support for generated Konnect API examples in the plugin docs, which makes the Konnect API more visible and positions it as a parallel option to the Kong Admin API.

A simple service example for the Basic auth plugin:
![Screenshot 2023-08-17 at 1 54 20 PM](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/assets/54370747/2168aff3-0bad-4d46-82f9-ed5964a083c2)

A global example for the Rate Limiting Advanced plugin:
![Screenshot 2023-08-17 at 2 57 19 PM](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/assets/54370747/d71f434e-7689-4a7a-bad4-9298621e49eb)

Along with that, there were several fixes/improvements that I had to make:
* Placeholders in curl examples: after team discussion, settled on `{ }` as the placeholder characters for URLs. This format is heavily used in our API specs, and is the OpenAPI standard: https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-parameters/. Going forward, we should be using `{ }` to enclose variables **in specs and API examples**. 
  * Placeholders in other situations still need revisiting. Out of scope here.
 
* The global example now explains what "global" means in the context of Konnect, Kong Enterprise, and Kong OSS. This is a long-running painpoint, and it seems timely to add this as we add Konnect examples.

* Removed the duplicate `konnect_examples` and `manager_examples` metadata keys from plugin docs. We don't have Kong Manager examples, and we don't need a separate `konnect_examples` key. `konnect: false/true` already performs the same function.
