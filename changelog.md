### [fix: Dead links on Vault Auth plugin](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6101) (2023-09-14)

There were a couple of links displaying like this: `[Consumer][consumer]`, which meant they were referencing link definitions that no longer exist. Fixing those links, updating some others, and doing some minor cleanup.

### [feat: Use real "edit" links for autogenerated reference docs](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6095) (2023-09-13)

We've had a few complaints from support and other users that it is difficult to find the source for our autogenerated docs: Gateway config reference, PDK references, and the CLI reference.

All of these references already have a `source_url` tag that links off to the source file that the doc is generated from. This update uses the existing `source_url` for "Edit this page" links, so that any page with a custom `source_url` set in its front matter will now link to the real source.

### [Update(plugins): GraphQL Introspection endpoint related note](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6090) (2023-09-12)

GraphQL Introspection endpoint will only be read from the Kong service (`service = ngx.ctx.service`) instead of reading from a specific variable or ingress - local.

Documenting this behavior so consumers are aware of how to configure correctly and know about the limitation

### [Revise KIC rate-limiting guide to use Secrets Management](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6069) (2023-09-15)

For https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/issues/4558

Refresh the KIC rate-limiting with Redis guide and add a Secrets Management section to it. Link the same guide from the sidebar as a Secrets Management guide. Several of the commits are basic formatting changes; most of the interesting content is in the later commits.

Most of an end-to-end Secrets Management guide is creating and testing a plugin, with only one minor step to add a vault  key and set the plugin to use it. Supported config fields for Secrets Management are also restricted, so we're mostly limited to plugins that can use authentication. Authentication unfortunately happens under the hood and isn't readily visible, but :shrug: 

Redis doesn't provide a convenient mechanism for setting a password using the base image currently used in the guide (it apparently requires awkwardly shoving a CLI argument into the container command), so this guide now uses the Bitnami Helm chart. I would prefer to avoid 3rd-party install methods, but the 1st-party Redis operator is apparently only for paid offerings (docs aren't entirely clear, but they label it "enterprise" and don't say that it can be used with free offerings). I don't think we want to keep the old one, as it doesn't offer anything other than not using Helm, but the initial content commit keeps it in tabs if we do want to.

### [fix: remove unsupported KIC feature](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6068) (2023-09-11)

Remove the custom entities guide from KIC 2.x pages.

This feature was never actually supported in 2.x, and we removed the leftover flag [in 2.9](https://github.com/Kong/kubernetes-ingress-controller/pull/3262). In earlier 2.x versions, the flag was available but did not work.



### [Clarify and improve DP Resilience feature notes](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6064) (2023-09-15)

In troubleshooting a support case, we discovered that there was no mention of the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` variable which is needed in certain situations. Added a line in the Configuration section to clarify this for AWS S3.

Some customers were also confused thinking they needed to manually create the file structure including the config.json file in the bucket, so I added a line that confirmed this is created automatically and should not be created manually.

Also aligned some wording between AWS S3 and GCP bucket instructions, just minor tweaks to verbiage. Also modified "read/write" to "read & write" to remove any possible misunderstanding of the forward-slash being seen as an "or" when both are needed on the bucket.

Tagging with Review:SME too just to double-check my recent learnings which I applied in part to this documentation page (specifically for my understanding of the AWS_SESSION_TOKEN situation).
