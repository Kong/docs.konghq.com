## Week 40

### [Move KIC docs to kic-v2 folder](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6249) (2023-10-06)

Renamed `_src/kubernetes-ingress-controller` to `_src/kic-v2` in preparation for KIC v3 docs



### [Fix: Badge alignment](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6245) (2023-10-06)

Badges & their tooltips are currently misaligned on h2-h5s:

<img width="777" alt="Screenshot 2023-10-05 at 1 46 26 PM" src="https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/assets/54370747/68ce7939-3e58-40b2-bcdb-b0489d5ac6ca">

This PR fixes the alignment for both.

While testing out the fix, I also noticed that we had some wrong badges applied to the Konnect section of the Gateway intro page. We got rid of Plus and Enterprise badges for Konnect with the switch to consumption-based billing, since it isn't accurate to apply either tier to features in Konnect anymore.

### [fix: Plugin tiers for konnect-incompatible plugins](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6235) (2023-10-05)

Some konnect-incompatible plugins were displaying Konnect Paid or Konnect Premium badges. This was happening because the metadata was incorrectly set to include either `paid: true` or `premium: true` for these plugins.

Fixing that, and adding a banner to konnect-incompatible plugin landing pages to call that out.

### [Chore: Gateway Vale cleanup](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6234) (2023-10-06)

Ran Vale on `app/gateway` and `app/_src/gateway` and fixed everything that came up.

Also ran into a few spots where I missed standardizing the hostname, so fixed those as well.

Vale should pass on this PR.

### [Update: Mark the canary plugin as not recommended for use with KIC](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6221) (2023-10-03)

Marking the Canary plugin as not supported for use with KIC.

From ticket:
> It looks like the way the Canary plugin works is not really designed to align with a Kubernetes-native philosophy and it doesn't really make sense to use with KIC.

We now have the Gateway API to cover for this functionality, so linking over to that instead.

### [Chore: Image cleanup](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6218) (2023-10-03)

Clean up old/unused images and organize into more intuitive directories.

**Note**: The `/diagrams` and `/docs` directories both come from Kuma docs. Ideally, the Mesh content would sit in a `/mesh/` folder as well, but I didn't want to mess with it yet.

New directory structure:
```
images
  diagrams # Kuma and mesh images
  docs # Kuma and mesh images
  icons
  landing-page
  logos # Kong logos only; third-party logos are under icons
  nav
  products
    gateway
    insomnia
    kic
    konnect
    plugins
  favicon.ico
  share.png
```

Idea from Rajie on future improvements: storing screenshots in the same directories as their markdown files. 
This would require building out some tooling, since our site currently looks for all images inside `app/assets`. 
Do we want to make an exception for how we handle screenshots in the future?

### [chore: Standardize the kong hostname as localhost](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6213) (2023-10-03)

Currently, example commands use a variety of terms to express the kong gateway hostname. Since this isn't standard, it can be confusing, because the readers see different placeholders and assume they're supposed to mean different things.

Using `localhost` as this is the placeholder that we already use the most, and it let you copy & paste commands easily.  It's also the model that the gateway quickstart guide follows.

### [Update: Add cache names to mem_cache_size](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6206) (2023-10-03)

According to our [changelog](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/CHANGELOG-OLD.md#core-32), these two in-memory caches are kong_core_cache and kong_cache.
