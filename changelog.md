# Changelog

## Week 36

### [chore: Split the gateway changelogs to archive changelogs for sunset versions](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6073) (2023-09-08)

Our Gateway changelog page is massive. This is a problem for everyone involved:
* Bad page load times/performance
* Difficult to edit
* Lots of unnecessary info
* Documenting versions that we don't support
* And the most recent discovery, a not-insignificant chunk of our Algolia records

This is yet another attempt to split some of the changelog content out. 
From now on, we will be archiving old changelogs at the same time we archive old versions of our docs. You can find the changelogs at https://legacy-gateway--kongdocs.netlify.app/enterprise/changelog/.

### [Fix(plugin scopes): Consumer groups scope and application registration plugin](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6059) (2023-09-05)

The [scopes compatibility table](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/plugins/compatibility/#scopes) was missing a column for consumer groups. This PR enables generating the column and all entries from the plugins' schemas.

Additionally, the Application Registration plugin was listed as incompatible with all scopes, which is wrong - it's compatible with services only. Turns out we were selecting for the wrong key. Fixing this also fixes the display of the plugin's [config](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/application-registration/configuration/) and [basic examples](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/application-registration/how-to/basic-example/), which were both missing services.

### [feat: Split serverless plugins into their own pages](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6047) (2023-09-08)

We currently document one entry for [Serverless Functions](https://docs.konghq.com/hub/kong-inc/serverless-functions/), but itâ€™s actually two plugins: `pre-function` and `post-function`. When searching for docs, users look for one of those names, not for Serverless Function. The UI also has them as two separate plugins, so one docs entry doesn't make sense.

This PR aims to solve that by splitting Serverless Functions into Post-function and Pre-function plugins. 
* For the titles of the plugins, I used the names from the Konnect and Kong Manager UIs: Kong Functions (Pre-Plugins) and Kong Functions (Post-Plugins).
* You can still search for these plugins by the term "serverless" and by their real names (post- and pre-function)
* I split out the how-to guide for the pre-function plugin into its own topic
* For the post-function plugin, I wrote a how-to guide based on a KB: https://support.konghq.com/support/s/article/How-can-the-latency-and-rate-limit-plugin-header-names-be-changed
* For both plugins, I also added short guide on running the plugins in multiple phases based on yet another KB: https://support.konghq.com/support/s/article/Is-it-possible-to-run-serverless-plugins-in-phases-other-than-the-access-phase

### [fix: change go-apiops to deck file in deck_file_remove-tags.md](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6037) (2023-09-06)

go-apiops cli is built for testing purposes. End users are encumbered to use this utility through deck file command.




What did you change and why?

I changed `go-apiops` cli example to `deck file`. As mentioned in [go-apiops repository](https://github.com/Kong/go-apiops)
> Currently, the functionality is released as a library and as part of the [decK](https://github.com/Kong/deck) CLI tool. The 
> repository also contains a CLI named go-apiops **for local testing**. For general CLI usage, prefer the decK tool [docs](https://docs.konghq.com/deck/latest/) tool.

 `go-apiops` is used for testing and deck is encouraged for general usage.
