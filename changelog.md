### [Fix: curl examples for custom plugins schemas in Konnect](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6252) (2023-10-10)

Turns out that you can't pass a file directly via cURL to our Konnect CP configuration API. The contents of the file don't get escaped correctly. When testing this out originally, I used a mix of cURL and HTTPie, and HTTPie had no issues - but our default cURL instructions have problems here.

Issue was reported on [Slack](https://kongstrong.slack.com/archives/C03NRECFJPM/p1696622470557839).

Updating the doc with Fero's help, tested it all with curl this time around.

The jq instructions are in a "tip", since we can't tell them to use jq if they don't want to or don't have it.

### [Update: Third-party categorization](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6236) (2023-10-11)

Third party plugins are now categorized as:
* Partner plugins: third party contributors that have a close relationship with Kong, usually meaning contracts, rigorous testing, etc.
* Unsupported community plugins: Plugins from contributors that haven't gone through the above process.

This update makes it clearer which is which by using better filtering, banners, and categorization.

### [Update: Add info on cache locations in Gateway 2.x vs 3.x](https://github.com/Kong/docs.konghq.com/pull/6192) (2023-10-11)

The latest version of the documentation refers only to the config.json.gz which is misleading as on 3.x this was moved to lmdb. It has been updated to reflect both noting the version change.
