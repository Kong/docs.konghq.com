subtitle: Manage Konnect and Kong Gateway configuration declaratively
---

decK helps manage Kongâ€™s configuration in a declarative fashion. This means that
a developer can define the desired state of {{ site.base_gateway }} or Konnect &ndash;
services, routes, plugins, and more &ndash; and let decK handle implementation
without needing to execute each step manually, as you would with the Kong Admin
API.
