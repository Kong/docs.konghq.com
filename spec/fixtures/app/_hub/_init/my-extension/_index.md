# This file is for documenting an individual Kong plugin.
#
# 1. Duplicate this file in your own *publisher path* on your own branch.
# Your publisher path is relative to app/_hub/.
# The path must consist only of alphanumeric characters and hyphens (-).
#
# 2. Create a versions.yml file in your new plugin directory.
# Set the Kong Gateway version that the plugin is being added to.
# Use the following format in that file (see docs/single-sourced-plugins.md for more info):

# releases: # Fill in the Gateway version that this plugin is being added in.

#
# 3. Add a 64x64px icon for the plugin to app/_assets/images/icons/hub.
# The name of the file must be in the following format: <publisher>_<plugin-directory-name>.png
