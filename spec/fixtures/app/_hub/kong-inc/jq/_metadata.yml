desc: Transform JSON objects included in API requests or responses using jq programs.
description: |
  The jq plugin enables arbitrary jq transformations on JSON objects included in API requests or responses.

  The configuration accepts two sets of options: one for the request and another for the response.
  For both the request and response, a jq program string can be included, along with some jq option flags
  and a list of media types.

  One of the configured media types must be included in the `Content-Type` header of
  the request or response for the jq program to run. The default media type in the `Content-Type`
  header is `application/json`.

  In the response context, you can also specify a list of status
  codes, one of which must match the response status code.
  The default response status code is `200`.

  {:.note}
  > **Notes:**
  > * In the response context the entire body must be buffered to be processed. This requirement also
  implies that the `Content-Length` header will be dropped if present, and the body transferred with chunked encoding.
  > * To use this plugin in Konnect,
    [upgrade your runtimes](/konnect/runtime-manager/upgrade) to at least
    v2.6.0.0.

  See jq's documentation on [Basic filters](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters) for more information on writing programs with jq.
