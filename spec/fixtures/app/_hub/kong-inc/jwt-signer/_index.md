## Manage key signing

If you specify `config.access_token_keyset` or `config.channel_token_keyset` with either an
`http://` or `https://` prefix, it means that token signing keys are externally managed by you.
In that case, the plugin loads the keys just like it does for `config.access_token_jwks_uri`
and `config.channel_token_jwks_uri`. If the prefix is not `http://` or `https://`
(such as `"my-company"` or `"kong"`), Kong autogenerates JWKS for supported algorithms.

External JWKS specified with `config.access_token_keyset` or
`config.channel_token_keyset` should also contain private keys with supported `alg`,
either `"RS256"` or `"RS512"` for now. External URLs that contain private keys should
be protected so that only Kong can access them. Currently, Kong doesn't add any authentication
headers when it loads the keys from an external endpoint, so you have to do it with network
level restrictions. If it is a common need to manage private keys externally
instead of allowing Kong to autogenerate them, we can add another parameter
for adding an authentication header (possibly similar to
`config.channel_token_introspection_authorization`).

The key size (the modulo) for RSA keys is currently hard-coded to 2048 bits.
