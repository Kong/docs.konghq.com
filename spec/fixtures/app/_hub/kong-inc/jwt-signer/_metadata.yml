  **Configuration Notes:**

  Most of the parameters are optional, but you need to specify some options to actually
  make the plugin work:

  * For example, signature verification cannot be done without the plugin knowing about
  config.access_token_jwks_uri and/or config.channel_token_jwks_uri.

  * Also for introspection to work, you need to specify introspection endpoints
  config.access_token_introspection_endpoint and/or `config.channel_token_introspection_endpoint.

  From \_index.md: The Kong JWT Signer plugin makes it possible to verify, sign, or re-sign
  one or two tokens in a request. With a two token request, one token
  is allocated to an end user and the other token to the client application,
  for example.
